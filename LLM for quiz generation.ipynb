      "When we use tools and machines for a long time, they can get worn out and not work as well as they used to. Maintenance means taking care of them regularly, like cleaning or replacing parts, so they stay in good shape and work properly.

There are three ways, or three \"modes\", that heat can move. The first one is called conduction, which is when heat moves through something solid, like how a frying pan gets hot and cooks a pancake. The second one is called convection, which is when heat moves in liquids or gases, like how warm air rises and cool air sinks in a room.

It won't let the electricity move through it, like a wall that stops you from going further. Some examples of insulators are plastic and rubber.
