       "'\"Good day, class. Today, we will be learning some everyday vocabulary and expressions in French. We will also learn how to count up to 20 in French. Let\\'s start with the times of the day. \\'Le matin\\' means morning in French. \\'L\\'aprÃ¨s-midi\\' means afternoon in French. \\'Le soir\\' is evening in French. Now, let\\'s look at the words for meals of the day. In French, \\'le petit dÃ©jeuner\\' is breakfast, \\'le dÃ©jeuner\\' is lunch, and \\'le dÃ®ner\\' is dinner. In French, the expression \\'j\\'ai faim\\' means \\'I\\'m hungry\\' and \\'j\\'ai soif\\' means \\'I\\'m thirsty\\'. You can try saying that along with me. Now, let\\'s learn some French words for fruits. In French, \\'une orange\\' is an orange, \\'une banane\\' is a banana, \\'un ananas\\' is a pineapple, \\'une papaye\\' is a papaya, and \\'une mangue\\' is a mango. It is important that you learn how to count in French. This will enable you to tell time and also deal with numbers. Let\\'s begin by looking at the numbers from one to twenty. \\'Un\\' is one, \\'deux\\' is two, \\'trois\\' is three, \\'quatre\\' is four, \\'cinq\\' is five, \\'six\\' is six, \\'sept\\' is seven, \\'huit\\' is eight, \\'neuf\\' is nine, and \\'dix\\' is ten. Okay, good. Now, from eleven to twenty, \\'onze\\' is 11, \\'douze\\' is 12, \\'treize\\' is 13, \\'quatorze\\' is 14, \\'quinze\\' is 15, \\'seize\\' is 16, \\'dix-sept\\' is 17, \\'dix-huit\\' is 18, \\'dix-neuf\\' is 19, and \\'vingt\\' is 20.

It all starts on the farm, where farmers cultivate crops like rice and harvest them for consumption. You've probably also eaten eggs before, either fried or boiled. But do you know that eggs come from chickens? When chickens lay eggs, they can be taken for consumption or left to hatch. This is done on a poultry farm. So, the rice farmer and the poultry farmer are both practicing agriculture. But what is agriculture? Agriculture is the cultivation of land and the production of crops, which includes the rearing of animals or livestock for human use. Just imagine what would happen without agriculture. Would there be enough food for us to eat? How about shelter? Would there be chairs for us to sit on? If not for agriculture, we wouldn't have leather made from cow skins, roofs and chests made from trees, or juice made from fruits like pineapple, apple, or coconut. Now, I am wearing clothes made from cotton, which is also a product of agriculture. Take a look at Nadia's farm. It's so big that she can't cultivate it herself, so she employs people to help her. How does she pay them? Well, she sells her food products in big markets and exports some to other countries. She usually gets enough money to expand her farm and pay her workers. So, you see how agriculture has helped us not only by providing food, shelter, and clothing, but also by making jobs available and serving as a means of making money, either by selling food and agricultural products in the market or on the streets, or even by selling abroad.```\",\n",

       " \"Hi! Did you know that computers are like robots that lack thinking capacity? Computers are machines that we use to perform simple and complex tasks to make our work easier and faster. Since computers cannot think on their own, we interact with them by giving instructions. We use input devices to do this. Let's take a look at some of the input devices we have. The keyboard is the most common type of input device with 104 keys used to type in alphabets, numbers, and functions. The mouse interacts with the computer through a process known as point and click to position the cursor, move objects, and open applications. The scanner is used to transfer images or texts into a computer from a book. The joystick is often used to control video games. Microphones are used to record voice and sounds into a computer and to send voice chats. The pen is used to point, write, or draw on a computer screen, and many others like the webcam, and so on. Today, we have learned and seen what computer input devices are. I hope you enjoyed today's class. See you in the next lesson. Thank you!\",\n",
       " \"Can you name a food item that is not expensive in the market today? When you go to the market, both sellers and buyers complain about the high cost of food. Everyone asks what the government is doing to help reduce the price of food products. This brings us to today's class on the roles of government in agricultural development. What are the roles of government in agricultural development? Let's take a look at a few of them. We all know that water and food are basic necessities of life. Water, especially, is needed by farmers to take care of their animals. So, the government could play the role of providing basic amenities like water and farm tools to farmers. Additionally, the government could provide basic inputs for the farmers. The government could establish all kinds of educational programs to assist uneducated farmers. The government can establish agricultural policies that help in increasing the production of suitable food crops. Also, the establishment of agricultural programs and planning. This stage comes after the government has stated its policies. Agricultural programs help in setting and executing future plans. When you are asked what the government is expected to do to improve agriculture, you know their responsibilities include providing basic amenities, farm inputs, and education for farmers.

They also provide funds by sponsoring many agricultural projects. In addition, NGOs provide basic amenities like water supply and roads to rural farmers. They also provide inputs such as fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides to rural farmers. \\n\\nNGOs provide irrigation and drainage to make year-round agricultural production possible. Some of the NGOs that provide support to rural farmers include the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Hunger Project in Ghana, Food and Agricultural Organization, West African Rice Development Agency, and many more. \\n\\nJust chat for learning this lesson.

       " 'Scientists like Thomas Edison, Isaac Newton, and others have made significant contributions to various aspects of science, from electricity to technology. However, there is also a branch of science that focuses on what we eat - the plants and animals. In this lesson, we will explore the roles of science and technology in agricultural development.\\n\\nYears ago, farmers had to rely on simple tools like cutlasses and spades to farm. But with the help of science and technology, agriculture now has modern farm machinery like tractors and harvesters. Science has also been able to explain the ideal climatic conditions for plants and animals, helping farmers know when to plant certain crops and how to care for animals during different seasons.\\n\\nIn addition, science and technology have played a crucial role in developing infrastructure such as roads, railways, and waterways that link food-producing areas to urban centers. They have also helped in sanitizing and immunizing animals against diseases and viruses. Other roles of science and technology in agriculture include improving soil fertility, developing storage and processing facilities, and more.\\n\\nThank you for listening to this lesson.

Do you know how these food materials are processed before they are sold in the market? Welcome to today's class where we will take a look at agro-allied industries. What are agro-allied industries? They are industries that depend on agriculture for their raw materials to operate successfully. In other words, agro-based industries require a supply of agricultural raw materials to provide finished products that are essential for human and animal consumption. A closer look at some of the agro-allied industries and the raw materials used will give us more insight. Agro-allied industries include the oil meal industry, which uses oil seeds as raw materials, the sugar industry, which uses sugarcane, the floor meal industry, which uses cereal grains, and the feed meal industry, which uses groundnuts and maize. Beverage industries use cocoa and coffee as raw materials, while the fruit scanning industry uses fruits. Other industries include starch with cassava and maize as raw materials, and tyre and rubber and latex as raw materials. I hope you found today's class insightful. See you in the next class.

       " '\"When a girl and a boy are born of the same parents, we describe their relationship as brother and sister. When two people work in the same company or office, we describe their relationship as colleagues. Agriculture, as a sector, has a relationship with organizations or industries which process raw materials into food suitable for consumption. The relationship between agriculture and industries is that agriculture provides food for industrial workers, while industries provide a large range of desirable goods that farmers want to buy. Additionally, agriculture provides a market for industrial products such as farm machinery, chemicals, and fertilizers. Industries provide storage facilities for agricultural produce such as grains, milk, fruits, and vegetables. They also provide agrochemicals for agricultural uses, such as pesticides, fertilizers, and herbicides. Their relationship also includes the production of raw materials. Agriculture provides raw materials such as cocoa, cotton, palm products, and granules for industries. Now we know that agriculture and industries share a relationship of providing employment, storage facilities, raw materials, and so on. See you in the next lesson. Bye!\"',\n",
       " 'Houses, hospitals, schools, and even the stadium where we go to watch and play football are all built on land. However, it is important to note that living in a house built on land does not make the people living there owners of the land. The system of land ownership can range from individual ownership to communal ownership. This means that a piece of land can belong to just one person or a community. \\n\\nSo, what is land tenure, you may ask? It is defined as the system of land ownership, either by an individual, family, community, or government agency for temporary or permanent use. Land tenure can either be communal, which means that a piece of land is the property of the community, or it can be based on inheritance. Inheritance refers to a person inheriting land from their parents or from one generation to another. \\n\\nAnother land tenure system is leasehold tenant, in which a farmer is allowed by the landowner to work on a piece of land for a fixed length of time under stipulated conditions. Whether it is communal inheritance or leasehold, we know that there are various land tenure systems applicable in Nigeria. Trust that you had fun learning in this lesson.

I'll wear my sunglasses to avoid sunburn and take water so that I can remain hydrated, else I faint. Not only do the sun and rain affect humans, but they also affect agricultural productions. Environmental factors affecting agricultural production include climate factors. Under climate factors, we have rainfall, humidity, temperature, light, wind, and pressure. Apart from climate factors, we also have biotic factors. The biotic factors are predators, which means organisms that feed on other organisms. We also have parasites. The third environmental factor is the edaphic or physical factor. This can include soil texture, soil structure, or soil pH, meaning the degree of acidity of a soil. Each time it rains or is sunny, remember that agricultural production is also affected. Just like that, you had an insightful lesson today. See you in the next lesson. Bye!\",\n",

Now, their farm is very small compared to Mr. Charles's farm. Mr. Charles's farm is very big, and he cultivates different kinds of crops on it. After harvesting the crops, he sells them at one of the big markets. Both Harvey and Mr. Charles are practicing farming, but Harvey is practicing subsistence farming while Mr. Charles is practicing commercial farming. \\n\\nSubsistence farming is a type of farming whereby food is being produced on a very small piece of land by a farmer to feed just his family. For example, if I plant bananas in my house or rear goats in my compound in order to feed my family, I am therefore practicing subsistence farming or peasant farming. \\n\\nCommercial farming is a type of farming in which food and cash crops are produced in large quantities for sale with the use of complex tools like tractors and bulldozers. Just like Mr. Charles's farm, he produces a lot of cash crops and sells them at the market. \\n\\nIn summary, we have two major types of agriculture: subsistence and commercial agriculture. Subsistence agriculture is concerned with the production of food, cultivation of crops, and rearing of animals by the farmer to feed himself and his family only with the use of crude tools like hoes, cutlasses, and so on. Commercial agriculture, on the other hand, is concerned with the production of food and cash crops in large quantities for sale with the use of complex tools like tractors, bulldozers, planters, harvesters, and so on.

Some say rocks served as hiding places for people in the old days. How true that is, I can't say. But let's see what a rock is. A rock is any mineral on Earth, like gold, beats, men, or other minerals. Rocks are treasured too. Amazingly, we have three types of rocks. What does this mean? It means that the rock in Abuja may be different from the rock in Abeokuta. \\n\\nIgneous rock: Have you seen charcoal turned ashes? The igneous rock is formed from the cooling and solidification of molten magma erupted from the Earth's crust. \\n\\nSedimentary rock: This is different from igneous rock. They are formed from rocks that have existed, which accumulate and consolidate over time. It is like a rock giving birth to another. \\n\\nMetamorphic rock: This type of rock is interesting to know about.

       " \"```How do you prefer your water, very cold or lukewarm? Personally, I sometimes enjoy it when it's ice-cold, like when you take an ice block out of the freezer and break it into pieces. However, if you don't return the pieces to the freezer, they will eventually melt and turn into water. This is similar to the process of rock weathering. Rock weathering is the process of soil formation, where rocks disintegrate into smaller particles to form soil. There are three main processes involved in rock weathering: physical, chemical, and biological. In the physical process, temperature plays a role. The rise and fall of temperature causes rocks to expand and contract, eventually leading to cracks and the formation of soil. The chemical process is called oxidation, where oxygen from the atmosphere reacts with rock, weakening it to form soil. The biological process involves the activities of plants and animals in breaking down rocks to form soil. Other processes include ice, rainfall, wind, pressure, carbonation, and more. Keep an open mind and enjoy learning in this lesson. See you in the next one!```\",\n",
       " \"Growing up, I had a lot of funny ideas and theories. One of them was that God used to send angels to create soil. However, I already knew that soil was formed from the disintegration of rocks. In a previous lesson, I mentioned how I threw a rock from a huge hill one day and saw it disintegrate. This made me wonder how so much soil was formed on Earth. I concluded that God sent angels to throw rocks from the skies every day to form soil on Earth. Of course, this idea was silly, but I wasn't entirely wrong. In the previous lesson, we also established that rocks disintegrate to become soil particles through the process of weathering. There are three processes of weathering, one of which is the physical process that we'll be discussing in more detail today. The physical agents involved in the process of weathering are temperature, wind, ice, water, and pressure. So, how exactly do all these work? Temperature causes an alternating heating and cooling of rocks that produces pressure within the rocks and causes them to break into smaller pieces. The wind carries rocks and other solid particles, causing them to drop into the soil. Rocks also contain water, especially inside the cracks. The conversion of this water into ice results in an increase in volume, eventually putting more pressure on these rocks and causing them to break into smaller particles. Running water could also carry some fragments of rocks from the rivers, thus breaking off small pieces. We have come to the end of this lesson. See you in the next one!\",\n",
       " '\"When I was in secondary school, my agricultural science teacher taught us that soil is formed from parent materials, which are rocks. I raised my hand and asked how rocks turn into soil. He explained that rocks break down through the process of weathering, which can be physical, chemical, or biological. He used an illustration to show the different ways rocks can break down. For example, throwing a rock from a building can cause physical weathering, while pouring a chemical on a rock can cause chemical weathering. In this lesson, we will focus on the chemical process of weathering, which involves reactions such as solution, carbonation, hydration, hydrolysis, and oxidation. For instance, when water combines with minerals, it can form rocks like gibson caso4 plus 2h2o minor caso4h2o red hematite. Chemical weathering can also work on rocks that contain iron through the process of oxidation. When water reacts with soluble particles in the rock, they eventually break down and form soil. This process is called solution hydrolysis. We hope you enjoyed this lesson and look forward to seeing you in the next one.\"',\n",
       " \"Take a look at this image. What can you see? Can you see insects and rodents burrowing into the soil, with some earthworms and termites attempting to burrow into rocks? Have you also noticed a man with a plow tilling the soil? What do you think is the effect of these activities on the soil? Let's assume that the farmland is filled with very coarse soil with pieces of rocks here and there. Do you think the activities will contribute to the breaking down of those rocks? Of course, they should, and this is what we refer to as the biological process of weathering. We have established that rocks, also called parent materials, disintegrate to form soil. We also say that there are three major processes of weathering through which this happens, and they are the physical, chemical, and biological processes. Today, we want to look at the biological process in detail. When we talk about biological factors, we are referring to living things like plants, animals, and human beings. Did you know that the activities of living things also aid in the disintegration of rocks to form soil? Let's discuss it. The roots of plants penetrate rocks to form soil. Insects and organisms like earthworms and termites also burrow into the soil and rocks, thereby aiding the disintegration of rocks. Activities of man in tillage cause rocks to break down and form soil as well. So, you see how big an impact biological agents have on the process of soil formation.

       " '\"Can you take a look at your surroundings? The soil in your compound is not the same as the soil in your school. Do you know why we have different soils in different places? Welcome to today\\'s class. Today, we will be discussing the various factors that contribute to the formation of different soils. The first factor is climate, which refers to the average weather conditions of a place measured over a long time. Another factor is rainfall. Running water, as a result of rainfall, causes gradual wearing away of rocks during erosion, giving rise to soil. Temperature is also a factor that deals with the alternate heating and cooling of rocks, which give rise to continuous expansion and contraction of rocks. Apart from climate, rainfall, and temperature, wind and pressure are other factors of soil formation. Now we see that soils do not just form for any reason, but are formed due to climate, rainfall, temperature, wind, and pressure. Trust your headphones and enjoy learning in this lesson.

       " \"When Booty was younger, he had a strong dislike for insects and other crawling things. He would follow his father to the farm and begin killing all the insects he could see. He remembered killing earthworms, termites, and other organisms he didn't even know the names of. In fact, Booty called it his daily mission to kill 100 crawling things in his father's farm every day. One day, Booty's father caught him and reprimanded him, but he was stunned. Who likes insects anyways? Why would Papa be annoyed? Papa then explained to him that the insects he was killing were actually very beneficial to the soil and, in turn, extremely beneficial to the plants. This is because their movement helped in tilling the soil. They also provided organic matter that was necessary for the soil. Are you also like Booty in thinking that insects have no usefulness whatsoever, especially on the farmland? Well, in today's lesson, we hope you change your mind. You see, insects and other soil organisms belong to a collective group that we can refer to as biotic factors. Biotic factors refer to living organisms like plants, trees, bacteria, grass, or molds. Biotic factors are very key in the formation of soil. Simply put, biotic factors are soil-living organisms, and they help speed up the process of soil formation in a good number of ways. Termites, earthworms, and rodents enable the soil to absorb organic matter gotten from leaves, wood, and other things. Soil organisms like earthworms also decompose organic matter, enabling the release of nutrients into the soil. These organisms mix inorganic particles like sand, stone, and clay with organic matter to form soil. In addition, they aerate the soil, making air react with rocks to form soil. When farmers till the soil, they also open up the soil and encourage biotic activity. Microorganisms also produce carbon dioxide, which promotes weathering of rocks. Leaves which fall from trees decay and increase the humus content of the soil. Now, do you see why biotic factors are essential in the formation of soil? I'll see you in the next lesson.\",\n",
       " '\"I guess it\\'s time to plant yam,\" Fred said. \"Well, he\\'s right since he has cleared the land and removed the stumps.\" Fred went ahead to plant the yam, and after six months, he had harvested it. You see, what Fred was doing after he planted the yam is a cultural practice known as post-planting operations. In simple terms, post-planting operations are the operations carried out after planting, which create good conditions and proper maintenance for plants to grow. \\n\\nSo, what are these operations? They include thinning, mulching, weeding, harvesting, and so on. Let\\'s take a closer look at what these operations entail. For instance, Fred is checking for weak seedlings and replanting the seeds that have refused to germinate. What Fred did by removing weak seedlings is thinning, and the replanting of seeds is supplying. Thinning is, therefore, a post-planting operation that involves the removal of excess weak or not well-positioned seedlings from a seed bed after the viable seeds have germinated. \\n\\nWhat about mulching? It is the covering of the surface of the soil with a layer of clean, dry vegetative parts of a plant, such as grasses or leaves, just like Fred did to his yam. After some months, Fred decided to harvest his yam, and at this point, he is harvesting. Harvesting is the removal of the ripe or matured useful part of a crop. So, when you pluck an orange or mango from the tree, it means you have harvested an orange or mango. \\n\\nIn summary, post-planting operations are the operations carried out after planting to ensure good conditions and proper maintenance for plants to grow.

Many would say that a farmer is a person who plants and harvests crops, and they wouldn't be wrong. In this lesson, we will be learning about the tools that were used by farmers in the past but are no longer in use today due to farm mechanization. Farm mechanization simply means the application of engineering principles and technology in agricultural production. Just as many adults wouldn't use a phone with buttons and would rather go for a touchpad phone, farmers would rather use machines on their farms than do the work themselves. What are the advantages of farm mechanization? It saves labor that could otherwise be useful elsewhere. Would you wash your clothes yourself when you have a washing machine at home? Probably not. It also reduces health hazards and accidents. Imagine a farmer using a cutlass to clear his farm when he could have used a machine for the same purpose to avoid injury. It saves time and ensures that work is done as soon as possible. However, there could be some disadvantages in using all these machines. For example, it is expensive to buy, hence requiring huge capital investments. Despite the usefulness of these machines, there are other crops that cannot be mechanized. From today's lesson, we can say that farm mechanization is the introduction of technology to agricultural production. See you in the next class. Bye!\",\n",

The effect of climate change on growth could be economically positive or negative for the farmer. If the climate is extremely cold or hot, animals will not eat well and will not grow well. If animals do not eat or grow well, we cannot have our milk or eggs. What about the effect of climate change on milk production? Excess sunlight brings about heat stress, while high humidity favors the growth of milk. The effect of climate change on egg production means that high temperatures reduce shelf life for eggs, decrease feed intake, and decrease the quantity of eggs produced.

Reproduction is the biological process that gives rise to new organisms, also known as offspring, from their parents. The young ones of animals like goats and hens are a result of this biological process. We can simply say that reproduction is the ability of animals to give birth to young ones. Animals like poultry birds and fishes are oviparous, which means they both lay eggs. Poultry broods over their eggs, while fishes do not. There are two reproductive systems: the male and the female reproductive system. The male system includes the testes, which produce the spermatozoa and sex hormone called testosterone. The female system consists of a pair of ovaries that produce egg cells where fertilization occurs. That's all for this lesson. See you in the next one. Bye!\",\n",

The breeds of pigs are Hampshire, Yorkshire, Large White, Landrace, Berkshire, Large Black, West African Dwarf, and Duroc. What are the characteristics of these pigs? Pork, which is obtained from pigs, is a good source of protein. Pigs are prolific animals, meaning they give birth twice a year, with eight to fourteen piglets per litter. They also mature quickly.

This system doesn't cost much money and reduces exposure to diseases. The third system is the intensive system, which restricts pigs within a building and does not allow them to move out of the compound.

Far away from him, in Nigeria, are Musa and Abu on a large piece of land with their cattle. Musa and Abu are herdsmen because they rear cattle and transport them from Nigeria to other countries in the world. There are various systems of rearing cattle. The first is an extensive system of rearing cattle. The extensive system is the system in which the herdsmen move about with their cattle from one place to the other in search of food and water. This type of cattle rearing is particularly practiced in Nigeria where herdsmen move from one place to the other. Secondly, there is a semi-intensive system of rearing cattle in which housing is provided for the cattle and they are allowed to move about a fenced compound with pasture. The third system of cattle rearing is the intensive system. In this system, the cattle are confined within a building with little access to grazing grasses. Zero grazing, water, and medication are supplied effectively to the cattle. Now we know that rearing of cattle can either be extensive, semi-intensive, or intensive system. See you next time.

       " \"A farmer planted two seeds and labeled them as plant A and B. Every day, he watered plant A and exposed it to sunlight, while he did not care for plant B. As a result, plant A grew beautifully, while plant B did not grow at all. The reason behind this is that plant A received adequate care, while plant B did not. Similarly, if we do not take care of ourselves, we may look lean and unkempt. This brings us to today's lesson, which is about nutrition. Nutrition is the process by which living organisms take in food to supply the nutrients required for continuous metabolic reactions in the body. Food is the major source of nutrients, and just like the example stated earlier, plant A grew because it received adequate nutrients, while plant B did not grow because it did not receive adequate nutrients. Today, we have learned what nutrition is all about. In our next lesson, we will discuss the modes of nutrition. Thank you, and see you in the next class!\",\n",

Just like the way we have different types of rice, there are two types of nutrition: autotrophic and heterotrophic nutrition.\\n\\nWhen a seed is planted, the farmer just waters it. The seed grows into a tree that bears fruits without any feeding because it can produce its own food. This method of feeding is known as autotrophic nutrition. In simple terms, autotrophic nutrition is the process in which the organism produces food from simple inorganic materials such as water, carbon dioxide, and mineral salts in the presence of sunlight.\\n\\nWhen you want to cook, you will go to the market to get pepper, meat, fish, and vegetables. Then, when you get back from the market, the food is prepared, and everyone eats. You cannot manufacture the food by yourself because they depend on plants to produce the food that will be cooked. This method of nutrition is known as heterotrophic nutrition.\\n\\nHeterotrophic nutrition is the type of nutrition in which the organisms can't manufacture the food but depend directly or indirectly on plants for their food. In today's class, we have learned about the two modes of nutrition: autotrophic and heterotrophic nutrition. Thank you so much for your time. See you in the next class.\",\n",

Similarly, ecology is made up of various concepts that we will be learning today. Environments refer to all the living and non-living factors surrounding an organism. Habitat is the place where an organism lives, just like how you live in your house, and it should be suitable for the organism's way of life. For example, if you were asked to live underwater for three hours, you wouldn't survive because the habitat doesn't suit you, but it's suitable for fishes since they live in water. Population refers to the total number of organisms of the same species living together in a given habitat, just like how you live with your parents and siblings in the same house. Community is made up of all the populations of living organisms that exist together in a habitat. Biosphere refers to all the parts of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere where life can be found, just like how our body has different parts. Ecosystem is a self-supporting unit made up of living and non-living parts that interact with each other. Ecological niche is the functional role and space of habitat occupied by a particular organism, which includes the organism's feeding and breeding habits. In today's lesson, we have learned about the various concepts of ecology. Thank you so much for your time, and see you in the next class.\",\n",

Lagos State is home to a diverse population with different cultures, such as the Igbo, Hausa, and Fulani, who communicate and interact well with each other. Lagos State can be compared to a biome, which is a collection of plants and animals that share common characteristics for the environment they exist in. Biomes can be found across different continents and are distinct biological communities that have formed in response to a shared physical climate. Terrestrial biomes are usually distinguished based on their climax vegetation, while aquatic biomes are often characterized by their dominant animal species. In Nigeria, biomes can be grouped into two major zones: the forest zone and the savannah zone. The forest zone is mainly made up of trees, including mangrove swamps and tropical rainforests, while the savannah zone is mainly made up of grasses, including southern Guinea savannah, northern Guinea, and Sahel savannah. Savannah is a grassland area with scattered trees and a hot, tropical climate. It has an extensive dry season with temperatures ranging from 24 to 29 degrees Celsius and an annual rainfall of 51 to 127 centimeters. In today's class, we learned about biomes and their characteristics. Thank you for your time, and we'll see you in the next class.\",\n",

Just like how you feel tired when you haven't eaten breakfast and it's already lunchtime, animals also need food to survive. However, unlike humans, animals cannot produce their own food and are dependent on other sources for their sustenance. Animals that can produce their own food are called autotrophs, while those that cannot are called heterotrophs. \\n\\nThere are three main types of heterotrophs: carnivorous animals, herbivorous animals, and omnivorous animals. Carnivorous animals, such as lions, dogs, leopards, and hyenas, feed only on flesh. Herbivorous animals, such as cows, goats, horses, tortoises, elephants, and gorillas, feed only on plants. Omnivorous animals, such as pigs, bears, raccoons, and birds, can feed on both plants and animals. \\n\\nJust like how some people choose to eat only plant-based foods and are called vegans, some animals are also classified based on their feeding habits. The feeding of animals for survival is known as animal nutrition. In conclusion, we have learned that food is essential for both humans and animals to survive, and animals are classified based on their feeding habits.\",\n",

However, if we hit the earthworm with an object, it would not wiggle. After the earthworm died, the salt would still be intact. It's important to note that detergent kills the earthworm faster than salt. Before pouring the detergent or salt on the earthworm, it was fat, but after the detergent or salt was poured on it, the earthworm shrinks. Enzymes are organic catalysts that promote or speed up chemical changes in living cells. They are usually proteinous in nature and do not change their composition in the process. Enzymes accelerate metabolic reactions without changing their composition. If you were asked to describe an earthworm, you would say that it lives inside the soil, has no arms or legs, and its body is segmented. Similarly, enzymes have characteristics that can be used to recognize them. Enzymes are proteinous in nature, remain chemically unchanged at the end of a reaction, are specific in actions, required in small quantities, speed up the rate of biochemical reactions in cells, are soluble, and can function outside the body of an organism that produces them. In today's lesson, we learned that enzymes help to speed up chemical reactions and do not destroy in the process. We also learned about the characteristics of enzymes.

       " \"When you disobey your parents and are given a punishment like carrying a stool for an hour, you may experience pain, but dropping the stool is not an option as it may result in further punishment. Similarly, when your parents ask you to fast, you endure the hunger until it's time to break the fast. This ability to endure discomfort is known as tolerance. Tolerance is an organism's capacity to survive variation in environmental conditions and endure unfavorable conditions. There are two types of tolerance: range and ecological. Range tolerance refers to the minimum and maximum limits to which organisms can tolerate certain changes in their environment to survive. Factors like rainfall, temperature, light intensity, and availability of food determine the geographical range of a species. Ecological tolerance refers to an organism's ability to adapt to changes in its environment. For example, if you were locked in a freezer room, your body would begin to go cold, and if no one came to your rescue, you would freeze to death because your body could not endure the extreme temperature. This is what happens to animals that cannot tolerate extreme changes in temperature. In today's class, we learned about adaptation, which is an organism's capacity to survive variation in environmental conditions. We also learned about the types of adaptation.

This is similar to how you and your best friend may wear the same dress shoes and go everywhere together. This is known as association. Biological association refers to the relationships or interactions among living organisms. These relationships can be voluntary or involuntary. For example, the lamb followed Mary involuntarily, while you and your best friend choose to wear the same dress voluntarily. There are six types of biological association: mutualism, commensalism, predation, parasitism, competition, and common salism. In today\\'s class, we learned about biological associations and how they help organisms survive in different environmental conditions.

They both decided to teach each other the subjects they don't know, making the two friends benefit from each other without harm. This type of relationship is known as mutualism. Mutualism can be defined as the interactions between organisms or two different species in which each organism benefits from interaction in some way. Like the two friends mentioned earlier, this type of interaction is common throughout all ecosystems. For example, oxpeckers, a kind of bird, and rhinoceros or zebra. The oxpeckers get food and beasts get pest control. It may involve the exchange of resources such as shelter, food, and other nutrients.\\n\\nOn the other hand, parents take care of you, pay your school fees, take you to fancy restaurants, and buy you lovely dresses without you paying for them or working for them in the office. This type of relationship is known as commensalism. Commensalism is a relationship between individuals of two species in which one species obtains food or other benefits from the other without either harming or benefiting from the organism it's gaining from. For example, nurse plants are larger plants that offer protection to seedlings from the weather and herbivores, giving them an opportunity to grow.\\n\\nHowever, two friends wrote an exam, and one of the friends opened his book for his other friend to copy. When they both received their scripts, the friend that allowed the other friend to copy got zero, while the friend that copied got 70 out of 100. The friend that got zero went to meet the teacher, and he was told that he got zero because he copied. This type of relationship is known as parasitism because in the story above, one friend passed, and the other friend that opened his book failed. Parasitism is a relationship between species where one organism, the parasite, lives on or inside another organism, the host, causing it some harm and is adapted structurally to this way of life. For example, fleas on dogs.\\n\\nIn today's class, we have learned about some of the types of biological associations. We will continue in the next lesson. See you then!\",\n",

When they arrived at the river, Peter's dad set up the hook and sink, put bait on the hook, and rolled it into the river. After a few minutes, Peter's dad caught a fish. This act of catching the fish is known as predation. Predation is a biological interaction where one organism, the predator, hunts and kills another organism, its prey. For example, a lion hunting a goat or a bear hunting for fish. \\n\\nThe books in the school library are usually limited, and during exams, everyone rushes to get the textbook in the library to read. Once the copies of the textbook have finished, anyone who doesn't have it will either fail the course. The rush to get the textbook is known as competition. Competition is a relationship between organisms in which one is harmed when both are trying to use the same resource related to growth, reproduction, or survivability. Competition stems from the fact that resources are limited. There are simply not enough resources for all individuals to have equal access and supply. Competition can occur between organisms of the same species or between members of different species. For example, when a lion and leopard hunt for the same animal. \\n\\nA goat was kept in a garden overnight. When the farmer came the next morning, the goat had eaten parts of the leaf.

In most cases, humans are the main contributors to environmental contamination. In this lesson, we will be discussing pollution, which is the defacing or contamination of the environment with substances that can harm biological organisms. When we litter or dump waste on the streets instead of using trash cans, we contribute to pollution. Activities of industries, factories, and nature also contribute to pollution. When our environment becomes unfit for habitation and our natural resources become harmful to us, we say that pollution has occurred. The substances that pollute the environment are called pollutants, which can be natural or man-made. Natural pollutants come from sources such as human and animal waste, while man-made pollutants include industrial waste, chemicals, and improperly disposed plastic bottles and cans. There are three main types of pollution: air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. We will discuss each of these in our next video. In this class, we learned that pollution is the introduction of harmful substances into the natural environment by human activities. In our next class, we will discuss each type of pollution in detail. See you there!',\n",

People won't be able to stay in the room because the smell of the spoiled food has made the air bad. Likewise, when wet clothes are packed in a closed room without opening the door and windows, the room will not smell nice because of the wet clothes. What happened in the room with the spoiled food and wet clothes is called pollution. Pollution is the introduction of a contaminant into the natural environment by human activities or pollutants, which are harmful substances that are toxic to nature. \\n\\nFor instance, Fred's mom was frying plantains for Fred and then went to the room to fold her clothes. She forgot about the plantains until Fred reminded her. When she got to the kitchen, everywhere was filled with smoke, and she couldn't breathe or see clearly because the air had been polluted with smoke. In this case, we have what is called air pollution. Air pollution is the release of harmful substances into the atmosphere from man's daily activities, for example, smoke, gases, and solids. \\n\\nJust like the way plantains can either be cooked or fried, we have different types of air pollutants, for example, dust particles, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. Just like the way the kitchen was filled with smoke, air pollution affects man by reduction in visibility, irritation of the eyes, dirtying of the streets, and so on. \\n\\nWhen you put a bucket of water outside for hours without covering it, within those few hours, the water will be filled with dust and dirt, making it unfit to use. The dirt on the water is known as pollution. Water pollution is the process whereby harmful waste materials are deposited into water bodies, making it unfit for animals and human beings. Water can get polluted by crude oil spillage, refuse and waste, and industrial waste. This pollutant makes the water unfit for animals and man's usage, resulting in the death of some organisms, loss of natural habitat, and so on. \\n\\nIn today's lesson, we have learned about the meaning of pollution, that is, the introduction of a contaminant into the natural environment by human activities.

A refuse dump site that is not incinerated or an abattoir without a proper disposal site, industrial and household waste, all of these are major constituents of land pollution. Let's get to know what land pollution means. Land pollution refers to the deterioration of the earth's land surfaces. It occurs mainly due to the direct and indirect effects of human activities. Pollutants of land could be solid or liquid waste, sewage waste from homes and factories, refuse waste, and other dry wastes. Agricultural waste, wood and metal objects, waste from refineries are all examples of land pollutants. \\n\\nWhat causes land pollution? When we dump refuse and sewage indiscriminately, practice deforestation that is cutting down trees without replanting, using fertilizer and other agricultural products excessively, allowing crude oil spillage and pipe leakage, all these lead to land pollution. When land pollution takes place, some of the effects that come through it include groundwater contamination through leaching, unsightly environment, and our land and valuable space can be overtaken by refuse. Now, indiscriminate sewage dumps can produce an offensive odor. I have been able to take you through the meaning, causes, and effects of land pollution. I'll see you in the next class.\",\n",

Conservation of natural resources is the preservation of natural resources through their judicious use to ensure their continuous availability. To conserve and protect the lives of wildlife animals like the young elephant killed by Baba Adi, the government needs to establish more zoological gardens and forest reserves where they can be kept.

You have to eat it on the floor or with something really hard to break the nut. Just as we cannot break a coconut like we do oranges, there is a concept in chemistry called elements. These are substances that cannot be split into simpler units by an ordinary chemical process, but can be saved by nuclear process.

In chemistry, elements or radicals need the right combining power, called valency, to cleave together and form a molecule or compound. Valency is the ability of an atom to receive or share electrons to achieve an octet state, also known as the oxidation number. Some elements exhibit more than one valency. A radical is a group of atoms with an electric charge that reacts as a single unit. Examples include NH4- and SO4-.

I couldn't separate the water, oil, and various seasonings she used in cooking. That's so sad. What I had before me was soup, something entirely different from all the ingredients used in preparing it. Like the pot of soup, there's a concept in chemistry called a compound. A compound is a substance that contains two or more elements chemically combined together. It has properties different from those of its component elements. For example, exfoliation often requires a large amount of heat, and it cannot be separated by physical means. Its components have a fixed ratio by mass, and they are homogeneous. So, what have we learned? We have learned that a compound is a substance that contains two or more elements chemically combined together, and they cannot be separated by physical processes because it is a product of chemical change.

To do this systematically, we can use the valencies of the compound element or radical house by following a set of rules. This sounds interesting, right? Have you ever heard of acronyms? We can remember our rules with the acronym W-Square E-B. Here's how it works: write the symbols of the elements or radicals in the compound and write their valencies below them. Then, exchange their frequencies and bring the symbols of the elements or radicals together. For example, H and SO4. H has a valency of one and SO4 has a valency of two. When we exchange the valencies, we get H2SO4. This simplifies the approach.

To address this, she developed a system where she would give out badges at the end of each week. Students who improved their behavior would receive a badge with a plus sign, while those who continued to misbehave would receive a badge with a minus sign. These badges had to be worn all week, and the system worked well as no one wanted to be seen as a child with bad behavior.\\n\\nIn chemistry, electrons carry a negative charge, and when an atom loses an electron, it attracts a plus sign. Conversely, when an atom gains an electron, it attracts a negative sign. These charged particles are known as ions, and they must carry their positive or negative charge everywhere they go. An atom or group of atoms that carries an electric charge is called an ion. When a group of atoms carries a charge, they are called radicals. An acid radical is a small group of atoms carrying a negative charge that maintains its identity. Examples include SO42-, NO3-, etc.\\n\\nIons are grouped as cations and anions.

       " \"Let me share with you how you can become a well-known scientist. You can achieve this by challenging the works of other scientists, not accepting the status quo, and seeking a better way of doing things. Now, let me tell you a story about John Dalton, a British physicist and chemist. In 1808, he proposed the atomic theory, which stated that all elements are made up of small indivisible particles called atoms. However, years later, other scientists emerged and discovered better solutions. For example, in 1919, Rutherford proved that the atom can be further divided into three constituents: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Dalton also said that atoms can neither be created nor destroyed in any chemical reaction, which is true for ordinary chemical reactions. However, it was discovered that radioactive elements undergo nuclear fission (breaking of atoms) and nuclear fusion (creation of new atoms). Dalton also said that atoms of the same element are exactly alike in all aspects and are different from atoms of all other elements. This was proven false by the discovery of isotopes, which showed that similar elements can have different mass numbers. Dalton also said that atoms of different elements can combine in simple whole number ratios to form compounds, which is true for many inorganic compounds. However, in the formation of large organic molecules like proteins, fats, and starch, and some very complex inorganic compounds, this has been proven false. Finally, Dalton said that all chemical changes result from the combination or separation of atoms. As future scientists, put on your thinking cap and see if this can be reinvented. So, what have we learned? We have learned about Dalton's atomic theory, his postulations, the limitations, and modifications to his theory. Let's take a look at the modifications to Dalton's atomic theory. First of all, the discovery of protons, electrons, and neutrons as constituents of the atom by Rutherford. Also, an atom is not an indivisible solid piece because we found the discovery of nuclear fission and fusion of radioactive atoms. Additionally, the discovery of isotopes, which are similar elements with different mass numbers, and the formation of very large organic molecules such as proteins, fats, and starch by carbon, and very complex compounds by trial zoo silicate five.

What our principal did made everyone study harder, and many students moved from average to excellence, as no one wanted a result booklet decorated with F\\'s.

A simple ion is assigned an oxidation number the same as the sign and size of the charge on the ion. For example, the oxidation number of K+ (potassium ion) and Al3+ (aluminum ion) are +1 and +3, respectively. However, when the ion consists of more than one element, its oxidation number is the sum of the oxidation numbers of all the elements in the ion. For example, the hydroxide ion (OH-) has a sum of oxidation numbers of -2 + 1, which gives us -1. \\n3. A compound is assigned zero, which is also the algebraic sum of the oxidation numbers of all its elements. For example, the sodium hydroxide compound (NaOH) equals zero, as we have +1 + (-2) + 1 = 0. \\n\\nWell, that\\'s so simple, right?

To get this answer, you simply subtract the sum of the mangoes received by the others from the total number of mangoes. This method can also be applied to calculate the oxidation number of an element in a compound. All you have to do is subtract the sum of the oxidation numbers of all other atoms from the algebraic sum. For example, what is the oxidation number of Fe in FeO, H2SO4, and NO3-? Let's calculate for Fe. We have Fe + (-2) = 0. Therefore, Fe = +2. Moving on to sulfur in H2SO4, we have +1(2) + (-2)(4) = 0. Collecting like terms, we get S = +6. Finally, for nitrogen in NO3-, we have N + (-2)(3) = -1. Therefore, N = +5.

In the previous lesson, we learned about Boyle's Law, which gives the relationship between pressure and volume. We also learned about Charles's Law, which gives the relationship between volume and temperature of gases. Is there a single equation that represents the relationship between pressure, volume, number of moles, and temperature of gases? Yes, there is. It's called the General Gas Equation, also known as the Ideal Gas Equation. When Charles's and Boyle's Laws are combined, we have a general equation that helps us determine the relationship between the three conditions and calculate the volume of a gas when there is a simultaneous change in temperature and pressure. Both laws are combined into a single expression known as the General Gas Equation. The three parameters stated appear in the General Gas Equation, which is P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2. However, it has been proven experimentally that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules. One mole of any gas at standard temperature and pressure occupies a volume of 22.4 L. Hence, the General Gas Equation states that for an ideal gas, PV/T is a constant. That is, PV = nRT, where P represents pressure in mmHg, V represents volume in cmÂ³, T represents temperature in Kelvin, and n represents the number of moles.

In today's class, we will be learning more about this type of bond. \\n\\nAn electrovalent bond involves the transfer of electrons from metallic atoms to non-metallic atoms during a chemical reaction. Atoms of an element try to achieve a stable duplet or octet configuration by gaining or losing electrons. The type of combination that involves the transfer of electrons from one atom to another is called an electrovalent or ionic combination. This type of combination takes place between the atom of a metal and the atom of a non-metal, where there is a transfer of electrons from the metallic atom to the non-metallic atom. \\n\\nIn an electrovalent bond, the metallic atom donates electrons and becomes positively charged, while the non-metallic atom accepts electrons and becomes negatively charged. An example of electrovalent bonding is the reaction between sodium and chlorine to produce sodium chloride. \\n\\nIonic compounds have unique properties.

       " \"In the previous lesson, we discussed the first type of bond known as electrovalent or ionic bonding. However, have you ever wondered what would happen if all the chemical bonds that lead to the formation of substances were ionic? Let's think about it together. If all substances were solid, ionic, and conductors of electricity, it would mean that there would be no oxygen, water, sugar, or carbon dioxide. That's a serious problem, and no one would want to live in that kind of world. This leads us to discuss the second type of bond, which is known as the covalent bond. These substances mentioned earlier are formed as a result of covalent bonding by sharing electrons. Covalent bonds are formed by the atoms sharing their valence electrons, and the shared electrons reside between the nuclei of the atoms forming the bond. It is noted that some atoms combine by a complete transfer of electrons, while others by sharing electrons. The chemical combination that involves sharing of a paired electron between two reacting atoms is called covalent bonding. In covalent bonding, electron pairs are shared between combining atoms, usually between non-metals, and molecules are formed. In a covalent bond, one shared pair of an electron is represented by a horizontal line between the two atoms. An example of covalent bonding is the formation of carbon dioxide. Carbon has an atomic number of six with four electrons in its outermost shell. Carbon needs four electrons to achieve a completely filled shell. Oxygen has an atomic number of eight with six electrons in its outermost shell. Oxygen needs two electrons to achieve a stable octet configuration. Two atoms of oxygen will combine with one atom of carbon by sharing valence electrons for the number of electrons in the outermost shell to complete it. The electrostatic force that results from this combination is called a covalent bond, and substances formed as a result are called covalent compounds, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and protein. Now, let's look at the properties of covalent compounds. First, they consist of molecules with a definite shape. Second, they are gases or liquid-like substances. Third, they readily dissolve in non-polar organic solvents. Fourth, they have low melting and boiling points. Fifth, they do not conduct electricity because the molecules do not contain charged particles. In summary, a covalent bond is the force of attraction between non-metal elements. It is formed by the sharing of valence electron pairs in the outermost shell of non-metal elements in order to attain stability, resulting in the formation of substances. Examples of substances formed from covalent bonding include oxygen, water, and sodium chloride. I hope you enjoyed this lesson, and I'll see you in the next class. Thank you.\",\n",

       " \"```Hi! In this lesson, we will be discussing Boyle's Law. As scientists, we make observations of natural phenomena and perform experiments to test their validity. These observations help us explain the things we see around us and how we can apply them to solve problems. This is why we are learning about Boyle's Law. Robert Boyle, in the 17th century, performed an experiment to test the behavior of gases. He wanted to see the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas. To do this, he used a J-shaped tool, which he closed at one end and left open to the atmosphere at the other. He then poured mercury into the open end of the tube, which trapped the air close to the closed end of the tube and compressed it. Boyle observed that as the mercury moved closer to the closed end of the tube, the greater the force exerted on the trapped air by the mercury, and the smaller the volume of the gas. He postulated that the pressure exerted on a given amount of gas is inversely proportional to the volume of the gas, given at that temperature, and it is constant. This means that when the temperature of a gas does not change, an increase in the pressure exerted on the gas leads to a decrease in the volume occupied by the gas. Boyle's Law can be expressed mathematically as V = k/P, where k is a constant. We can also use the formula P1V1 = P2V2 to calculate for either pressure or volume. We can test Boyle's Law by observing how a decrease in pressure affects the volume. Boyle's Law can also be explained using the kinetic theory. When you fill a container with air and compress the gas, the volume of the gas will decrease because the molecules of the gas will collide with each other more rapidly. However, if you reduce the pressure, the molecules are further apart, and the number of collisions for unit time decreases, resulting in a decrease in pressure. Applications of Boyle's Law include spray painting, joining fields into AC range, and pumping up bike tires. However, the law fails at high pressure and low temperature. At low temperature and high pressure, the speed of the gas molecules decreases, and they move closer together. Under these conditions, a real gas will liquefy. I hope you enjoyed today's class.

       " \"Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a scientist named Charles. This scientist observed that whenever there is a change in temperature of gas molecules, it leads to a corresponding change in the volume of the gas molecules. He then performed an experiment that explains this common behavior of gases and exposes the reason for this behavior to us. This experiment led him to postulate what is called today the Charles' Law. \\n\\nNow, to understand what this law is about, let us perform a similar experiment that Charles performed. If I blow up a balloon and pour some boiled water into a beaker, I will try to dip the balloon into the boiled water in the beaker. The heat from the boiled water will warm up the balloon. Let's leave it for some time. Okay, now if I bring out the balloon, see what do you notice? The balloon has increased in size, right? Why? It is because the boiled water has a higher temperature, and the higher temperature energy of the water and the steam molecules transfer is the lower temperature energy molecules inside the balloon, exciting the molecules in the balloon. \\n\\nHave you ever been told that inactive and unhappy? Maybe you are returning home from school very hungry, and upon getting home, someone prepared your best dish. How excited would you be? You jump up and run around the house to drop off your bag, excited to mount your best dish. Think of 10 students like you in similar conditions in the same place. The excitement and sorting brush of activity from secreted adrenaline, that is the same thing that happens when air particles gain energy when they are heated up. So, from our experiment, when the air molecules in the balloon are excited by breathing temperature, they spread further and further apart, increasing the space they take up. \\n\\nSo, as higher temperature goes, the molecules get excited, they move in a disorderly manner all around, and cause the balloon to increase in volume and size. That is why the balloon was bigger when we brought it out of the beaker with boiled water. Oops, the balloon is gradually reducing the gain in size. The air molecules are losing energy again and getting less extracted. If we put this balloon now in the fridge where it is cold, we notice the size will reduce more and even shrink. These molecules are losing more energy and getting more dull. \\n\\nSo, let's update the Charles' Law. The Charles' Law states that the volume of a given mass of gas is directly proportional to its temperature, provided that the pressure remains constant. Now, this law can be expressed mathematically as V directly proportional to T, where V equals volume in centimeter cube, and T equals temperature in Kelvin, and V equals K times T, where K is a mathematical constant. When K is mid-subject, we have V1 over T1 equals V2 over T2, such that when making observations between these changes, we can calculate temperature and volume before and temperature and volume after. \\n\\nIn summary, when the temperature of a fixed mass of gas increases, the volume increases automatically, and when temperature decreases, there is a corresponding decrease in volume, provided pressure remains constant.

At the end of the term, KG moved from second to last in class to the 10th position. Wow! The private tutor did an excellent job. Do you know that the teacher played the role of a catalyst? He hastened the academic performance of KG in just a short time.\\n\\nAlso, long-chain hydrocarbons of petroleum can be cracked in the presence of a catalyst like zeolites to speed up the process. It's good to know that today we have learned that long-chain hydrocarbons can be heated in the presence of a silica alumina or zeolite catalyst. This catalyst speeds up the process, which requires less energy and lower pressure. High grades of petroleum are produced by increasing the octane number of petrol. The temperature is still about 500 degrees Celsius.\\n\\nThis catalytic cracking is more widely used because, first, the process is more controllable, and conditions can be adjusted such that desirable products of specific chain lengths are obtained. Second, the process not only yields more petrol but also gives petroleum petrol high in quality. Here's a reaction to show the process. I'm sure you enjoyed today's lesson.

It helps you secure a higher income, develop problem-solving skills, and improve the economy. Similarly, the process of cracking is also very beneficial. The benefits of cracking include increasing the yield of petroleum, providing a petrol mixture rich in branched chain hydrocarbons with an attendant increase in octane number. Additionally, it is used as a by-product of a large quantity of ethane, propane, and butane. Therefore, we have learned that the cracking process is useful and beneficial in petroleum refinement. It increases the yield of petroleum, provides a petrol mixture reaching branch chain hydrocarbons with an attendant increase in octane number, and is used as a by-product of a large quantity of ethane, propane, butane, etc. These by-products are used for making plastics, synthetic rubber, detergent, and many important chemicals like itano and phenol.

The state built new public schools, renovated old classrooms, employed more teachers, and equipped them with state-of-the-art materials. Did you know that a similar act of reforming is also practiced in chemistry? In chemistry, reforming is the process of converting long-strained chain hydrocarbons to shorter and branching molecules to improve their anti-knock properties. This process is used to prevent the knocking of engines caused by petrol containing long-chained hydrocarbons. The reforming process takes place in the presence of catalysts such as oxides of silicon or aluminum at about 600 degrees Celsius and pressure between 8 and 15 atmospheres. This process increases the petrol's octane number and produces high-grade petrol. It's important to note that reforming is an isomerization change, which means it changes a compound into its isomers. On the other hand, cracking is a breaking down process. I hope you enjoyed today's lesson. See you in the next one!\",\n",
       " \"```John and Femi were rated as the top three overall best students at St. John's College. On the other hand, Philemon, James, and Saul were rated as the overall least performing students. This was determined by comparing their scores in various subjects. Those who had more A's received a higher rating, while those who had more E's and F's received a lower rating. Similarly, the quality of petrol at St. John's College is also rated based on its level of performance in engines. The octane number or rating of petrol is determined by the proportion of branch chain hydrocarbons to straight chain hydrocarbons in a given blend of gasoline. If the percentage of branch chain hydrocarbons is higher than that of straight chain hydrocarbons, it is given a high octane number. However, if the percentage of straight chain hydrocarbons is higher than that of branch chain hydrocarbons, it is given a low octane number. This is because straight chain hydrocarbons, such as heptane, burn too rapidly in car engines, causing irregular motion of the piston, resulting in rattling noise, also known as knocking. A straight alkane like heptane is assigned an octane number of zero, while a higher branch chain alkane like 2,4-trimethylpentane is assigned an octane number of 100, which burns very smoothly in engines. Therefore, the quality of any petrol is rated according to its octane number, which is the percentage of 2,4-trimethylpentane in a mixture.

We had the best time of our lives, and at the end of the day, athletes were rewarded for their performance. Those who performed well were given a gold medal, while those who didn't do well received a handshake. Just like athletes, petrol can also be graded based on its octane number. If the octane number is closer to 100, it is designated as super or extra, while if it is far from 100, it is designated as regular or ordinary. Today, we have learned that petrol can be graded as super or extra petrol and regular or ordinary petrol. Petrol graded as super or extra has an octane number closer to 100 than petrol graded as regular or ordinary. The octane number of straight-chain hydrocarbons is related to their molecular mass. The lower the molecular mass of the hydrocarbon, the higher the octane number. Some fuels, which are superior to two to four trimethylpentane, have an octane number greater than 100.

You should try that out!\\n\\nJust like artificial flowers, we also have synthetic petrol. It is made from materials such as coal, coke, and hydrogen, which do not occur in crude petroleum. When powdered coal is heated with hydrogen in the presence of iron or tin as the catalyst at 500 degrees Celsius and 20 atmospheric pressure, it is converted into an oily mixture of hydrocarbons. The mixture is separated by distillation into a petrol fraction boiling at 200 degrees Celsius and heavy oil residue, which can be further heated with fresh coal to obtain more petrol.\\n\\nSecondly, when steam is passed over heated coke at 100 degrees Celsius, a mixture containing equal volumes of carbon 2 oxide and hydrogen, known as water gas, is obtained. So, you have the equation C + H2O to give you water gas. The water gas can be hydrogenated to a mixture of hydrocarbons by passing it over finely heated nuclear catalyst at 200 degrees Celsius. About half of the product is petrol, and the less volatile fraction is used as well for diesel engines.\\n\\nWow, interesting!

The carbon dioxide is then reduced to carbon monoxide. We have learned that carbon monoxide can be prepared by passing carbon dioxide through red-hot carbon while the carbon dioxide is itself reduced to carbon monoxide. The gaseous mixture is passed through concentrated sodium hydroxide to remove the excess carbon dioxide. So we have CO2 + C to give you 2CO. The pure carbon monoxide is collected over water.

Now, I'm smiling myself just like Timmy. Water molecules have a way of breaking the bonds by tying two ions together and giving them its hydrogen and hydroxide ions. This is a concept in chemistry called hydrolysis. Interesting, right? Did you know that some salts undergo hydrolysis in water to give an acidic or alkaline medium? Yes, they do. Let's look at this example: Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacts with water and is broken into sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbonic acid (H2CO3). Can you spot the new position of the hydrogen and hydroxide? That's a smart one. Now, let's look at this equation: Na2CO3 + H2O â†’ NaOH + H2CO3. We have learned that hydrolysis is a type of decomposition reaction where one of the reactants is water, and it is used to break chemical bonds in other reactants. Hydrolysis of salts occurs when salt reacts with water. For example, when the salt of a strong acid and weak base reacts, it gives an acidic solution. The change in the pH of the solution is due to hydrolysis. I hope you enjoyed that class. If you didn't, I did. Hope to see you in the next class. Bye for now!```\",\n",

       " \"Here's a revised version of the text:\\n\\nThere are different methods and ingredients used to prepare fried rice and delophrites. Similarly, when preparing salt, you need to check its solubility. If it is soluble, you can prepare it by reacting a dilute acid with a metal, neutralizing an acid with an alkaline, reacting a dilute acid with a soluble base, or reacting a dilute acid and a trioxide carbonate. However, if it is not soluble, you can prepare it by either reacting the constituent elements or mixing two suitable compounds, one containing the metallic radical and the other the acidic radical of the insoluble salt. This method is called double decomposition.\\n\\nAnother criterion to consider when preparing a salt is its stability. If it can be decomposed, the salt can be separated out of a solution by a method called crystallization. However, if it cannot be decomposed, the soluble salt can be recovered after preparation by heating to dryness.\\n\\nIn summary, we have learned that salt can be prepared in various ways, and to know the method required, you must be sure of its solubility or stability. A soluble salt can be prepared by the action of dilute acid on metal. For example, zinc solid (Zn) combines with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to give us zinc chloride (ZnCl) and hydrogen gas (H2). Another way to prepare a soluble salt is by neutralizing an acid with an alkali. For instance, potassium hydroxide (KOH) in aqueous form plus nitric acid (HNO3) in nature's form gives us potassium nitrate (KNO3) and water (H2O).\\n\\nAn insoluble salt can be prepared by double decomposition or precipitation. For example, lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) in aqueous form plus sodium chloride (NaCl) in the cross form gives us sodium nitrate (NaNO3) in aqueous form and lead chloride (PbCl2) in solid form. Another way to prepare an insoluble salt is by the direct combination of two elements. For instance, iron (Fe) in solid form combines with sulfur (S) to give us iron sulfide (FeS) in solid form.\\n\\nIf the salt can be decomposed, it can be recovered from a solution by a method called crystallization. All salts with nitrate (NO3-) and tetrasulfide (S4-) are recovered by crystallization. Alternatively, if the salt is not destroyed or decomposed by it, it can be recovered by heating to dryness. For example, salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), iron (III) chloride (FeCl3), and iron (II) chloride (FeCl2) are recovered by heating.\",\n",

Is there a difference between them? Of course, it's obvious. One is dry, and the other one is wet. Next, try to eat the wet sand. It is going to lose its water, right? Like the dry sand, there are salts that do not contain water of crystallization. They are called anhydrous salts. On the other hand, there are salts that have water in them. The water molecule is loosely held to the salt molecule, and when heated, like the wet sand, they can lose it. They are called hydrated salts. So, what have we learned? We have learned that salts can also be classified into anhydrous and hydrated salts. Anhydrous salts do not contain water and cannot request the lights out of the AQR solution.

The difference between the two is that the bar absorbs the water and becomes solid, while the cassava flakes form a solution. In chemistry, there are substances that absorb water when exposed to air and form a solution. These are called deliquescent substances. On the other hand, some substances absorb moisture from the atmosphere without forming a solution. If they are solid, they are called hygroscopic substances. However, if the hygroscopic substance is a liquid, it acts like a juice and will only be diluted. There are also substances that give out their water of crystallization when exposed to air, and these are called efflorescent substances. In summary, we have learned that certain compounds either lose their water of crystallization or absorb moisture from their surroundings when exposed to air. The terms efflorescent, hygroscopic, and deliquescent are used to describe these salt compounds. Efflorescent substances lose some or all of their water of crystallization when exposed to air, resulting in a loss of weight or mass. An example is Na2CO3.10H2O, which decomposes to give Na2CO3.H2O + 9H2O. Liquid substances absorb water from the air and form a solution, resulting in a gain in weight. Examples include NaOH, CaCl2, and FeCl3. Hygroscopic substances absorb moisture from the atmosphere without forming a solution.

When it is passed through a fractionating column, it produces various products at different temperatures. Would you like to know how this happens? Kindly follow me. \\n\\nFirst, the crude oil is heated to about 400 degrees Celsius so that all the components are vaporized. Secondly, the vapor enters the bottom of the fractionating column and rises up the column. As it cools down, those with high boiling points condense to liquids and will not move far up the column, whereas those with low boiling points will move towards the top of the column. \\n\\nThen, the substances with higher boiling points separate out in the trays on the lower part of the column, while those with lower boiling points separate out in the trays on the upper part of the column. Finally, the fractions are collected in horizontal trays at different heights on the column. \\n\\nToday, we have learned that to separate the components of crude oil, it is passed into a fractionating column with a temperature ranging between 400 degrees Celsius at the bottom of the column and 4000 degrees Celsius at the top part of the column. The fractionating column is divided into several compartments by perforated plates called trays, each of which is maintained within a specified range of temperature. \\n\\nWe distill to improve the purity and then further treat to obtain different liquid fuels and petrochemicals. The petroleum fractions are gases, petrochemicals, diesel oil, lubricating oil, and vitamin. Thanks for joining today's lesson. See you in the next one!\",\n",

It\\'s fascinating to know that natural gas, which is a fraction of petroleum, mainly consists of hydrocarbons containing one to four carbon atoms per molecule. These hydrocarbons are used for synthesizing a large number of compounds such as methanol and butadiene. Examples of such hydrocarbons are methane, ethane, and propane. Methane and ethane are usually burnt for fuel, while propane and butane are liquefied and distributed in high-pressure gas cylinders or tanks for lighting and heating purposes in homes. They are also used for synthesizing a large number of compounds, for example, methane for methanol and butadiene. I hope you enjoyed today\\'s lesson!\"',\n",

I can't go to school without my books, and I can't carry all of it with my hands, so my backpack is indispensable. Similarly, petrol is the most important product derived from petroleum. This is because of the rapid increase in the use of motor cars. Petrol is a complex mixture of volatile hydrocarbons containing six to ten carbon atoms per molecule, such as hexane, heptane, and octane. It is obtained through distilling between 50 degrees Celsius and 200 degrees Celsius. Petrol is used as fuel for airplanes and vehicles, and it is also a good solvent for paints, grease, and stains.

However, if a person is withdrawing 10,000 error, they can easily collect it over the counter. Similarly, the method of collecting gases depends on their solubility and density. If the gas is denser than air, it is collected by downward delivery and upward displacement of air. On the other hand, if the gas is less dense than air, it is collected by upward delivery and downward displacement of air. Today, we have learned that the collection of gases during preparation is dependent on their density and solubility. The two methods of collecting gases are downward delivery, also called upward displacement of air, which is used for collecting gases that are denser than air. Examples include CO2, SO2, H2S, NO2, chlorine, and hydrochloric acid. We also have upward delivery, downward displacement of air, which is used for collecting gases that are less dense than air.

Today, we learned that to identify an unknown gas as CO2, you must bubble it through a solution of lime water (calcium hydroxide). If the lime water turns milky due to the formation of insoluble calcium carbonate, then the unknown gas is CO2. When calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide, it produces calcium carbonate and water. If the gas is bubbled in excess, the milky mechanism disappears and turns into a clear solution.

Jesus was indirectly talking about how he is going to be the one who strengthens our Christian life. This does not imply that he was going to turn into bread like he turned water into wine. He was going to be someone we can draw strength from to move forward. Just like after eating, there is an attempt to continue our daily work.

For example, when you feel like you are being tempted, you can flash back to what Jesus did when he was tempted. When you feel like things are falling apart, you can remember that in the face of death, Jesus did not renounce his faith. Through his life, you are strengthened to grow in your walk of faith.

As a result, our school soon recorded a high number of enrollments because parents wanted their wards to be in a school where its students are known for all-round excellence, just like those prefects who were good citizens of the school. Christians are to be upright and obedient to higher authorities, not only in church but wherever they find themselves, so that people of the world can notice the difference and decide to be a part of God's kingdom. I hope you enjoy the class.\",\n",
       " \"Centuries ago, the major means of communication was through letter writing. Lokwemi's grandmother would tell her about a certain Mr. Oni, who happened to be Midi's father. Mr. Oni had traveled to a faraway land before Midi's birth, with the promise of building a mansion in a place where life would be more comfortable for his family. He boldly stated that when he comes back to Adeomu, it will be to take his family to a better home. It has been 10 years since he left, and Midi has never seen him. However, she does not miss her dad. This is not because she despises him, but rather she found a way to communicate with him. She always wrote to her father, telling him about herself and her experiences as a growing adult. Mr. Oni was also quick to reply to his daughter's letters. He would write about how much he loves her and how he is putting things in place for her arrival. Whenever she writes that she needs advice on certain issues, her father would always write to her ways to handle the situation. If she makes requests, her father is always sure to provide her needs. Even though she has not seen him, she is sure that her father, wherever he is, does care about her so much that he will come to take her to a better place. Likewise, prayer is the means to communicate with God directly. Though we cannot see Him physically, because He hears our prayers, we believe that the writings of the Bible are true when it says God cares about all that concerns us.\",\n",
       " \"In the previous class, we learned that prayer is a way of communicating with God. Just like we can talk to our friends and family through various means like SMS, WhatsApp, and video calls, prayer is a way to reach out to God. James, in his letter to the church, emphasized the importance of being intentional about our prayers. It's like not talking to our loved ones for a whole month, which would be weird. Similarly, we should communicate with God every day. James also stressed the importance of believing in God's competence when we pray. For instance, if the richest man on earth asked for our bank details, we would gladly give them because we know he is wealthy and capable of crediting our account. Similarly, we should believe that God hears us and will answer our prayers. However, we must understand that God does not answer evil requests because He is good. We cannot ask God to do something that goes against His commandments. Therefore, when we pray, we must understand the worth of God, believe in His ability to answer our prayers, and ensure that our requests align with His word. I hope you enjoyed this class.\",\n",
       " 'Imagine you are standing in front of your school assembly and everyone is watching you. Suddenly, you begin to pick your nose and fight with your friend. That would be such a terrible thing to do. As Christians, you must be aware that people will always pay attention to you and everything you do. This is why you must constantly do the right things at the right time. You must ensure that you stay away from bad behaviors that could tarnish who you are as a Christian. Why? Because God has placed you higher than non-Christians. Involving yourself in bad activities could bring you low and make non-Christians believe they are better than you. Peter reminds Christians that God has made them special and to be called a Christian, they must ensure to leave all their past ways behind them, maintain good behaviors, and be an example to non-Christians. According to the Apostle Peter, Christians are to live their life like Jesus did. They should learn to respect authorities and offer help to people in need. Christians should also cast their vote when necessary and be of good behavior to maintain peace in their community. In conclusion, you should bear in mind that Christians are called to live like Christ on earth. Until next class, bye.',\n",
       " 'By now, you must be familiar with the term \"Yahoo\". Almost everyone is interested in it and they make it seem like it\\'s a good thing. However, in reality, it is a terrible thing to do as Christians. We are created to be like Christ, and we must do away with terrible things that non-Christians paint as good. The Bible makes us understand that all of these things that non-Christians paint as good are not good because they are signs of the end time. With how fast the world is being civilized, things like stealing, drug abuse, indecent dressing, cybercrime, and vandalizing, which are called social vices, are made to appear normal, even though they go against the standard God has set for us. Even though God has warned us in the Bible that some of these vices would come up once it is close to the end time, some Christians are still falling victims to these vices. Christians should learn to avoid social vices by preaching the gospel unashamedly, allowing the Holy Spirit to live in them, and leaving an exemplary life. Conclusively, social vices can be defined as the delicacies and atrocities that have seeped into society as a result of westernization. Hope you had a great time, Lenny. See you in the next class.

       " \"Have you ever watched a movie that you loved so much that you couldn't wait to tell your friends all about it? This is similar to how Apostle Paul orders us to share the word of God with our family, friends, and society. The word of God is nothing to be ashamed of and should be shared as a gift among everyone. By doing this, you can help many people experience the gift of salvation and build a relationship with their heavenly father. In Matthew 28:19-20, the Bible tells us to go into the world and preach to everyone, including children, adults, and the elderly. So, how do you preach the gospel? You can do so by sharing the gospel with your friends personally or going to people's houses to tell them about salvation and living a life that is worthy of emulation. In conclusion, Apostle Paul, in his letter to the Romans, ordered us to use his life as an example, as he was unashamedly sharing the gospel. I hope you had a great time learning. See you next class.

       " \"Joy was patiently waiting in the queue to get her books at the bookstore. However, her classmate Peace, whose mother was friends with the owner of the bookstore, didn't have to wait in line. Peace confidently jumped the queue and was attended to immediately. Joy wasn't pleased with this, but she knew there was nothing she could do about it. Have you ever been in a situation like Joy? How did it make you feel? I'm sure, just like Joy, you would have been deeply hurt. This type of situation happens a lot in our society. Many people are unhappy because they never get what they want. Why? Because they don't belong to a particular tribe, religion, or even political party. It's sad that a lot of poor people suffer because nobody considers them in society. In most cases, the rich are considered first when they apply for jobs, business loans, or when they need anything at all. The leftovers are divided for the poor. The poor never get trusted for anything. This same problem of impartiality that happens in the community has been brought into the church. In most churches, the rich are allowed to rule over the poor. They let them become the head of many departments, leaving the poor to handle jobs like cleaning the toilets and sweeping the church. Apostle James encouraged the church to remember that God loves everyone equally, and everybody should learn to treat themselves with love and respect, irrespective of their social status. In conclusion, Apostle James and Cory suggest that Christians should practice impartiality outside of the church so that there will be peace and unity among members of society. This will also kill any form of distrust and competition while fostering a sense of unity and belonging. I hope you had a swell time learning. I would see you in the next class.\",\n",
       " \"How would you react if you heard that someone who had died suddenly woke up? I'm sure you would be amazed. Well, I'm here to tell you that Jesus did just that so that we could be saved. The story of Jesus rising from the dead is recorded in the Bible in three different versions: Matthew, Mark, and Luke. All of these versions are correct, but because we all have different ways of explaining things, the synoptic Gospels give similar but slightly different accounts of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The three books recorded that Jesus' female friends, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jesus, and Salome, were present at the tomb when Jesus was resurrected. However, only Matthew recorded that an earthquake happened and an angel descended from heaven and rolled the stone from the tomb. The versions of Luke and Mark, on the other hand, only recorded an angel sitting on the stone of the tomb waiting to announce that Jesus had resurrected. The book of Luke also showed that the women were confused about how to roll the stone from the tomb. The confusion was put to rest when they saw a young man, an angel, sitting in front of the tomb. It was the same angel that told them to hurry and spread the news to the disciples that Jesus had resurrected. Even though the disciples didn't believe them, Jesus' resurrection proved to Christians that God had washed away their sins and brought about salvation. It also formed the foundation of every Christian's faith. Without the resurrection of Jesus Christ, there would not have been proof that Jesus was indeed the Son of God. In conclusion, resurrection can be defined as the revival of a person who should have been dead. Hope you had a great time. See you in the next class. Bye!\",\n",

Moses' father came and instead of helping Nonso by taking him to the hospital, he decided to shout at him.

He was very brilliant and loved by both his teachers and schoolmates. Although he came from a wealthy family, he loved hard work. He decided to use his spare time to learn graphic designing in an office close to his house. Every day after school, he would finish his homework and run to the graphic design office. After some months, he became very good with designs, and the workers began to admire him. The owner offered to pay him a huge amount of money if he could continue to work with them after school. Gopai agreed and started to make extreme money every week. \\n\\nToday, Gopai is a final year student at the university, where he is studying graphic design. It is encouraged that even as you go to school and read your books, learning a skill of interest is an amazing way to be self-independent. That means a person like Gopai, with such a skill, will not need to depend excessively on the government or his or her parents for survival. Such people are self-dependent because they know how to use their hands to make money. They have been empowered. \\n\\nEmpowerment involves a process of inculcating values to equip the learner to lead a life that is satisfying to the individual while being in accordance with the cherished values and ideas of society. Today, we have the Youth Empowerment Scheme and Skills Development, which is one of the most effective means of combating unemployment in our communities. Youth empowerment is a development program that intends to create opportunities that will encourage and develop youth to be skillful, morally responsible, self-reliant, and financially productive. These programs are possible when the government, organizations, or even individuals decide to support the youth by creating some of these opportunities for them.\",\n",
       " 'There are many skills that one can learn to become independent. Do you remember Gopep, the graphic designer? Gopep learned artistic skills that helped him develop the ability to process creative qualities, enabling him to excel in producing creative works. Other skills that can make one independent include vocational or entrepreneurial skills such as makeup artistry, hair designing, and catering, which teach one how to become a skilled business owner or producer of goods and services. Gopep also learned coping skills as he went about learning graphic design. These skills helped him deal with the realities, expectations, and challenges of life. As a student, he was able to cope with his books, house chores, and learning graphic design from school. He was also able to learn and build his intellectual skills. The knowledge he gained from school helped him acquire the ability to think, understand ideas, perspectives, and process information. Gopep had a friend named Ella. Although Ella did not learn graphic design like Gopep, she had amazing leadership skills. She was the captain of her class and knew how to manage people and relate to all her classmates. She was also very skilled in goal setting and decision making. Outside of this, Ella was a good communicator. She could communicate very clearly, not just because of the way she spoke English, but because of the way she presented every situation. She knew how to convey messages effectively, when to talk, how to talk, and who to talk to at the right time. Gopep, on the other hand, had amazing negotiation skills. For instance, when the owner of the office where he learned his graphic design skills wanted him to start working with him after school, Gopep negotiated very well to his favor. This skill helped Gopep develop the amazing ability to price, settle differences, launch campaigns, etc. In summary, youth empowerment skills include manipulative skills, decision-making skills, artistic, vocational, and entrepreneurial skills, among many others.',\n",

During an election, the institution in charge of elections, such as the electoral commission, plays a crucial role.

However, before the election, candidates must have registered with their own party. This brings us to another democratic institution known as political parties. Political parties are registered bodies of people who share a common political interest, which is to gain political power. For example, in Nigeria, we have several political parties like APC (All Progressive Congress), PDP (People's Democratic Party), ADP (Action Democratic Party), and so on.

The arms of government refer to the division of governmental power into three branches. In a modern political system, we have the executive branch, which is responsible for policy making and implementation. Your class captain writes the names of noise makers and ensures they face punishment. This is implementation. The executive branch maintains law and order and manages all the activities of the government. We also have the legislative branch, which is responsible for law making. We can compare your class teacher to a lawmaker who will say that anyone who makes noise will be punished. The legislature can impeach the president of a country and set up panels to investigate the activities of any department of the government. Finally, we have the judiciary, which is the branch of government that interprets the law. They act as a check and balance to the other branches of government. We have defined the arms of government as the division of governmental power into three branches in a modern political system. The three branches are the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. Hope you had an amazing time learning. See you in the next class. Bye!',\n",

As an individual, you possess the liberty to express yourself and move around freely. But what exactly is freedom? Freedom is the right to express oneself or think without any hindrance or restraint, and the absence of a despotic government. There are several reasons why freedom is crucial. Firstly, it prevents dependency and allows individuals to be self-sufficient. Secondly, it enables people to make decisions easily, such as what to eat or wear. Thirdly, freedom promotes a healthy society. Fourthly, freedom does not allow for an authoritarian government, as the two cannot coexist. Democracy is the only way for freedom to exist.

This led to the development of the abacus, which uses beads and stones on wooden, metal, or stone tablets. The abacus is the oldest form of computer. Computers have existed in different forms throughout history and have evolved over time. Today, we will be discussing the first generation of computers and their limitations.\\n\\nAs far back as 1946, there was no best way of storing instructions and data in computer memory. However, digital computers using electronic valves, vacuum tubes, were developed during this time, which are known as first generation computers. These computers were in use from 1946 to 1954. Although these computers were good, they had limitations. First, they were large in size, slow in processing, and had less storage capacity. They were also not very accurate or reliable.\\n\\nIn today's lesson, we have discussed the first generation of computers and how they emerged.

Well, computers that produce heat and were very slow have now been replaced. Around 1955, a device called the transistor replaced the bulky vacuum tubes in the first generation computer. Now, transistors are smaller than vacuum tubes and have higher operating speeds. They have no filament and require no heating. In fact, the manufacturing cost was very low, and as such, the size of the computer got reduced considerably. Examples of the computers of the second generation are IBM 1620 and IBM 1401. So, we have come to the end of this class.

The third generation of computers was introduced between 1964 and 1977 and utilized integrated circuits. These computers were small, low-cost, had large memory, and high processing speeds. Eventually, integrated circuits were replaced by LSI (large scale integration), which consisted of about 100 components.

Since computers cannot think on their own, we interact with them by giving instructions. We use input devices to do this. Let's take a look at some of the input devices we have. The keyboard is the most common type of input device with 104 keys used to type in alphabets, numbers, and functions. The mouse interacts with the computer through a process known as point and click to position the cursor, move objects, and open applications. The scanner is used to transfer images or texts into a computer from a book. The joystick is often used to control video games. Microphones are used to record voice and sounds into a computer and to send voice chats. The pen is used to point, write, or draw on a computer screen, and many others like the webcam and so on.

A computer language is a special language understood by a computer. It consists of various commands that we give to the computer to perform any task. Just like in mathematics, where we have mathematical symbols such as addition, multiplication, and equals to, in computer language, we have a set of words, symbols, and codes used to write a computer program. The process of writing these instructions is called programming, and the people who write these programs are called programmers.

However, computers have a physical body that we can interact with, which we can see, touch, feel, move, and where physical injury, damage, wear and tear can come to computers. This body is what is known as the computer's hardware. My guess is that you're probably using a computer device to access this lesson right now. How do I know? Well, there is no way you could have done this without physical contact with your computer device, whether it's a desktop computer, laptop computer, or even a smartphone. To do this, you must have pressed the button to turn on your device, looked into a screen, or listened to the speaker that produces sounds. These physical components of your computer that you can touch, like the keyboard, mouse, monitor, storage disk, touchscreen, and system unit, are what is referred to as hardware because they are tangible and mobile. They can be classified based on their functions into five components, which are input components used to instruct the computer, like the mouse, keyboard, scanner, camera, and so on, output components that bring out desired results from the instructions we have given the computer, like the speaker that produces sound, monitor that displays, printer, and the projector system. The system unit is responsible for the circuitry and logical functions, the processing unit is responsible for converting raw ideas to required information, and the storage device is for keeping our files and documents in a safe form until needed.

This means that some parts of the computer are visible while others are not. The visible parts of the computer that can be seen, touched, and felt are the hardware components, while the parts that are not necessarily visible are the software. In clearer terms, software is the non-physical component of a computer provided by the manufacturer to assist the computer operators or users in making the best use of their machine. This is distinct from the specific programs written to solve specific problems. For instance, a video game being played on a computer can be seen on the monitor and probably played with the keyboard. The keyboard and monitor can be seen, but the game cannot be seen or felt. Examples of computer software include internet browsers like Google Chrome, video game applications, or a video player, etc. The software could be system software or application software.

       " \"```Hello there! Welcome to yet another interesting class. Today, we'll be discussing data processing. Do you remember the story of Mr. Idea that we shared with you in our last class? He predicted and analyzed the past, present, and future using basic facts that were inputted into a processing system, such as a computer. If you recall, thumbs up to you! \\n\\nNow, the next question is, how does he process this data? Don't be scared, this is what we'll be discussing in a short while. Just like how nobody eats raw rice, raw beans, or raw yam, they all have to be processed into either fried rice, porridge beans, or boiled yam, respectively, before they can be edible. Similarly, with our data, unprocessed data is meaningless to us. Data processing is, therefore, the task of collecting basic facts to produce information. Usually, this data doesn't have values or is useful in itself until it is subjected to analysis, validations, and comparisons with other data to produce information for decision making. \\n\\nFor example, when we process data to search for the individual amount of foodstuff left in our kitchen, such as the number of tubers of yam, the number of cubes of Maggi left, or the amount of bottled water left in the fridge, information is definitely produced based on the information supplied. Mummy can, therefore, make a list of food items to buy at the market and further request the equal amount of funds from daddy to make this purchase at the market. Can you now see the importance of data processing? \\n\\nIn summary, we have learned that data processing is an operation on a computer that involves entering, sorting, updating, and retrieving information using a computer. Data is collected, captured, prepared, presented, precise, complete, accurate, purposeful, and assigned. Thank you and bye for now!```\",\n",
       " \"Hello there! Welcome to the last part of our topic on data processing. In this lesson, we'll be discussing the various activities involved in processing data. Just like cooking rice, there are different steps involved in processing data, such as collecting, verifying, validating, coding, classifying, sorting, calculating, summarizing, and storing. \\n\\nLet's start with the input activities. There are three steps involved in input activities. The first step is collection, which involves gathering data from various sources and assembling it in one location. The second step is verification and validation, which ensures that the data collected is accurate and complete. This step is crucial in eliminating the possibility of garbage in cabbage house, popularly known as GIGO. Lastly, coding is the last activity involved in the input activity. Our data must be converted into a machine-readable form in a language that the processing system, which is often the computer, would understand so that they can easily be processed. Entering data via a computer terminal and keyboard is a practical example of coding.\\n\\nMoving on to the processing activities, there are five different stages involved. The first stage is classification, which involves organizing or categorizing data according to certain characteristics to make it meaningful to the user. For instance, we can categorize the types of food items we have in the kitchen into grains, tubers, liquids, spices, and the likes. The next stage is sorting, which involves arranging the grouped data element into a predetermined sequence to facilitate processing. After sorting, we calculate. Calculation is the arithmetic or logical manipulation of data, such as computing student point average, customers' bank balance, and employees' wages. The summary comes next. Oftentimes, working with a large volume of data can be tiring, hence the idea of summarizing comes in. Reducing a large amount of data to a concise usable form called summarizing helps to produce quick and useful information. The final stage under processing activity is storing. Storing helps us to keep data that are not immediately needed. They can be stored on a disk, a tape, or CD-ROM.\\n\\nFinally, we'll look at the output activities. This process only involves retrieving data, printing data, and data communication. In conclusion, our society is becoming more competitive and more technologically advanced, leading to the high volume of data being generated daily. Hence, data processing becomes very vital. We'll stop here today. Do well to attempt the quiz questions attached to this lesson. Thank you and bye for now!\",\n",

Trust me, it is a fascinating one. We'll categorize this history into three aspects: early mechanical calculation devices, early electromechanical counting devices, and early electronic counting devices. In a quest to make calculations faster and easier without the use of counting figures, scientists have put in every effort to have better methods of calculating. The first devices we'll be looking at are abacus and slide rule devices, which fall under the early mechanical calculation devices. Do you know that the abacus was probably the first calculating device? Yes, the Chinese invented it. Some countries still use it because of its simple operation. As shown here, it is made up of a frame divided into two parts by a horizontal bar and vertical threads. Each thread contains some beads. The abacus is used to calculate simple addition and subtraction. The second invention under the early mechanical calculation method is the slide rule. Before the smartphone, the laptop, and the graphic calculator, there was the slide rule.

Today, we will be discussing the classification of computers based on their purpose. Computers can be grouped into two categories: general purpose and special purpose. General purpose computers are designed to solve a wide range of problems, such as word processing, graphics, databases, spreadsheets, and more. On the other hand, special purpose computers are designed to solve a specific set of problems, such as medical diagnosis, weapon guidance, traffic control, weather study, and forecasting. We will stop here for today, but in our next class, we will dive deeper into the classification of computers. I hope you enjoyed the lesson. Please attempt the quiz below.

       " \"Today, we will be discussing the classification of computers by size. Did you know that computers can be generally categorized into four types: supercomputers, mainframe computers, mini computers, and microcomputers? \\n\\nSupercomputers, also known as monsters, are the largest, fastest, and most expensive computers in the world. They cost several millions of dollars and can perform between 600 million to 900 million instructions per second. Scientists use supercomputers for weather forecasting, exploration, and complex calculations such as Siri XMP.\\n\\nNext on the list are mainframe computers. They are large in terms of price, size, and internal memory and have a variety of peripheral devices such as printers and plotters. Mainframe computers usually need a specialized environment with controlled dust, temperature, and humidity. They are used in large establishments such as banks and airports. Examples of this type of computer are IBM 360 to 370 and CRV 8800.\\n\\nMini computers were developed in the 1970s for specialized tasks. They are special-purpose computers that are smaller, less powerful, and less expensive than mainframes. Mini computers are easier to install and operate than mainframes. Examples of mini computers are PDP-2, VAX 750, NTR9300, DEC, HP 3000, and many more.\\n\\nFinally, let's talk about microcomputers. A microcomputer is a computer whose central processing unit (CPU) is based on a microprocessor. Microcomputers are currently the most popular type of computer in the world. They are very small, less complex, and less powerful than mainframes or mini computers. They are easy to use and are also known as personal computers (PCs). Microcomputers are used for various purposes because they are cheap, small, and do not require a special environment for operations. They can be used anywhere in the world.\\n\\nWe have come to the end of our lesson today. I hope you enjoyed it.

       " \"```Hello there! Welcome to today's class. In our world today, information is one of the essential parts of our lives. Every day, we get informed via words, text, and even from reading online. Digitalization is the process of converting information into a digital format. This information may be represented as an object, image, sound, document, or signal. Usually, it is organized into a discrete set of points or samples, which is binary data that computers and many devices with computing capacity, such as digital cameras and digital hearing aids, can process. We can also say that digitalization is the integration of digital technologies into everyday life. Digital systems use a binary numeric system in which electronic pulses are represented by either zero for a low pulse or one for a high pulse. Digital can more easily represent symbols, such as alphanumeric characters that represent real-world data, than the analog system. Amongst many benefits of digitalization are long-term preservation of documents, orderly archiving of documents, easy and customized access to information, easy information dissemination through images and text, CD-ROM, internet, and extranet. Furthermore, we have four types of digital computers: microcomputers, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and supercomputers. We'll stop here today.

In a short while, we\\'ll take a look at the sectors where ICT has played a major role. \\n\\nIn the educational sector, ICT has made research for teaching materials and online conferences possible. ICT has also been used as a reference tool, which is used to collect and process data. Also, interactivity during learning has been made easy. \\n\\nIn the banking sector, all processes carried out in the banking system are all carried out using the computer system. Supervisions, assessing company accounts by businessmen online, are all possible through the use of ICT. \\n\\nIn our industries, computers are used to facilitate the production planning control system, automate the production of goods, analyze and collect data for the future, and used by administrators to oversee the entire operations in the factory. \\n\\nBuying and selling connection between buyers and sellers online and keeping records of all transactions in the commerce sectors are all made possible through computers. \\n\\nIn conclusion, positively, we can now see that ICT has impacted our society. It\\'s obvious that we now have faster communication speed, lower communication cost, reliable mode of communication, effective sharing of information, and even borderless communication. However, the use of computers has always come with these negative effects.

You can find a text editor in your device\\'s messaging app, WhatsApp, Facebook app, or even your device\\'s notepad. The reason for this is that every device has an operating system, such as Windows, Android, or Linux, which comes with a simple program called a text editor. Just like your picture editor, which allows you to edit your pictures, the text editor allows you to edit text, copy, insert, and save. This means that on December 25th, when you decide to text \"Merry Christmas\" to a loved one via SMS or chat, you will have to use a text editor. Yes, that little box you click on that brings out your keyboard. A simple program that does word processing is the word processing text editor.

In fact, there is no organization, corporate or non-corporate, where spreadsheets cannot be used. They can be used in offices, schools, government offices, bakeries, industries, and more. The uses of spreadsheets include administrative uses, creating reports, preparation of daily sales, computing school results, storage and calculation of data as directed, using existing data for project development, budgeting control, drawing balance sheets, analyzing and decision making. Spreadsheets make calculations much easier than working things out manually. I hope you learned something. Thank you and bye for now.',\n",
       " 'In this lesson, we will be discussing the different parts of speech, just like how we have different parts of the human body such as the head, nose, eyes, teeth, hands, and legs. The parts of speech include nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. Today, we will be focusing on conjunctions. \\n\\nConjunctions are words that join two words or groups of words together. Examples of conjunctions include \"and,\" \"but,\" \"both,\" \"neither,\" \"nor,\" \"because,\" and \"so on.\" These conjunctions can be categorized into different types such as coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions, and correlative conjunctions. \\n\\nCoordinating conjunctions join words or groups of words that are of the same grammatical rank. Examples of coordinating conjunctions include \"and,\" \"or,\" \"but,\" and \"for instance.\" \\n\\nSubordinating conjunctions introduce subordinating clauses. Examples of subordinating conjunctions include \"after,\" \"because,\" \"before,\" \"if,\" \"in other that,\" \"since,\" \"which,\" and \"when.\" \\n\\nCorrelative conjunctions are used in pairs. Examples of correlative conjunctions include \"either or,\" \"not only but also,\" and \"neither.\" \\n\\nIn summary, conjunctions are important parts of speech that join words or groups of words together. By understanding the different types of conjunctions, we can improve our writing and communication skills.',\n",

Most people that work in such companies like the bank, accounting firms, and offices would rather tell others they have a white-collar job instead of mentioning the names of the office. Idioms are expressions that cannot be gauged from the meanings of the individual words. It is a kind of expression that is formed based on certain principles.

For example, in the sentence \"We bought a brand new car,\" the word \"car\" acts as the subject of the sentence. In the sentence \"The boy in the red shirt is my friend,\" the word \"friend\" acts as the subject. Nouns can also act as objects of verbs, such as in the sentence \"The teacher scolded the students,\" where \"students\" is the direct object. Nouns can also act as subject complements, as in the sentence \"His village made him achieve that,\" where \"chief\" is the complement. Additionally, nouns can act as complements of prepositions, such as in the sentence \"The president complimented the intelligence of lawmakers during the speech.\" Finally, in the sentence \"The boy hid his ball under the chair,\" the noun \"ball\" is the object of the verb \"hid.\" Thank you for spending time with me today, and I\\'ll see you in the next class.',\n",

You\\'re watching this video, so if you were asked what you are doing right now, you would likely say \"I am watching Afroland videos.\" What about what you did yesterday? For instance, you must have brushed your teeth yesterday morning, right? When you are asked, you would say \"I brushed my teeth yesterday morning.\" That means we have done things in the past, which we express using what we refer to as past tense. What we\\'re doing is expressed in present tense. So, what do we mean by tense? Tenses are verbs that express the timing of an action or the performance of the action, which might be in the present, past, or future time. In today\\'s lesson, we will focus on the present tense. \\n\\nWhat is present tense? Present tense is a tense that expresses actions we do on a daily basis or habitual actions, like \"I write,\" \"I eat,\" or tense that expresses ongoing actions like \"I\\'m eating,\" \"I am walking.\" So, present tense can be categorized as simple present tense, present continuous tense, present perfect tense, and present perfect continuous tense. Examples of simple present tense are \"write,\" \"sleep,\" \"run,\" and \"walk.\" For instance, \"I walk,\" \"I work,\" \"I dance.\" A simple present tense expresses those actions that we do on a daily basis. For example, \"I eat rice every morning,\" \"I jog every day,\" \"I walk to school daily.\" The simple present tenses are also used to state the natural or the universal truth. For example, \"The earth is spherical,\" \"Birds fly so high.\" \\n\\nPresent continuous tenses are used to express actions that are ongoing. For example, \"coming,\" \"going,\" \"writing,\" \"sleeping.\" They are formed by adding \"-ing.\" For instance, \"I am speaking,\" \"You\\'re watching videos,\" \"She\\'s cooking.\" Present perfect tenses are formed by adding \"has/have\" before the verbs. For example, \"I have bought the bag,\" \"They have gone out,\" \"Bran has gone to work.\" Then, the present perfect continuous tenses are formed by adding \"has/have\" before the \"-ing\" verbs. For instance, \"Lucy has been singing since she was eight,\" \"They have been working on it.\" \\n\\nSo, we said that tense is an aspect of the verb that expresses the timing of an action. The performance of the action might be in the present, past, or future time. And now, we have four types of present tenses. We have simple tense, simple present tense, present continuous tense, present perfect tense, and present perfect continuous tense. I hope you enjoyed the class. See you next time!',\n",

It is also used to express a condition. For instance, \"if I had a car, I would drive it every day\", \"my friend would have come to the party if he had the money\", and \"no one would have thought that the boy was capable of riding a horse\".

For example, \"This is John Spann\\'s\" or \"It is nobody\\'s business.\" We met in Joe\\'s car or we met at Joe\\'s house. The possessive form for plural nouns ending in \"s\" is denoted by adding an apostrophe after the \"s.\" That\\'s the sign; the \"s\" is only added to nouns and not to possessive pronouns like hers, yours, theirs.

However, what happens after the meeting when no one is able to explain what happened or how many people were present? This is why it is important to have minutes written for every meeting. Minutes of the meeting are a form of a report that record the events and discussions that took place during the meeting. For every meeting, there should be a prepared agenda, which is a list of items to be considered or discussed during the meeting. The minutes of a meeting are usually numbered in sequence. For instance, if you are writing the minutes of an annual meeting for a club or association, it should follow the sequence of items on the agenda that was already sent out to members. An example of this sequence could be: introduction, opening minutes of the last annual general meeting, matters arising from the meeting, treasurer's annual report, secretary's annual report, president's annual report, election of officers for the following year, and then closing.

Let\\'s explore the functions of different punctuation marks. The full stop, also known as a period, is used to indicate the end of a sentence or statement. For example, \"My daughter is a good girl. I finished my work.\" The full stop tells you that the statement has ended. In contrast, when I arrived at school today, the teacher was absent. I have to visit the restroom immediately - end of discussion. Abbreviations and shortening with full stops are used to mean \"etc.\" For instance, \"Art,\" \"Mean,\" \"Junior,\" etc. are initials given when using initial or numbering. We use a full stop after each number, such as \"Boy,\" \"Girl,\" \"John,\" etc. When listing items, we use commas to separate the items, words, phrases, or classes in a list or series. For example, \"She bought some oranges, apples, tomatoes, and onions.\" The dash is used to indicate a break in sense or a faltering speech. For instance, \"If you tell a lie, I shall know it - so remember that before you speak.\" Remember, practice makes perfect. Apply your full stops, commas, and dashes to sentences to make them meaningful.',\n",

Similar to an older sibling, a clause is superior to a phrase because it has some attributes that place it above a phrase, such as the subjects, predicates, and the finite verb. Let\\'s take a look at an example of a clause that has a subject and a predicate: \"Joy wore a new gown to the church yesterday.\" In this sentence, \"Joy\" is the subject, while the other words serve as the predicate. Did you know that there are two types of clauses? The independent clause and the dependent clause. An independent clause is also known as the main clause or the principal clause because it expresses a complete thought and can stand on its own in a sentence. For example, \"My father is a philanthropist\" and \"Frank is a good singer.\" On the other hand, dependent clauses are called dependent clauses because they do not express a complete thought and cannot stand on their own in a sentence. They depend on the main clause for their meaning. Dependent clauses are also called subordinate clauses. For example, \"Which he said that he told us.\" You will observe that a dependent clause is mostly incomplete sentences. The subordinate clause is of three types: the noun clause, the adjectival clause, and the adverbial clause.

Remember, we said that words like \"big\" become \"bigger\" and \"small\" becomes \"smaller.\" We could have gone further to make \"big\" become \"biggest\" and \"small\" becomes \"smallest,\" but that would not be comparative anymore. What comparative does is that it picks the second degree of adjectives, not the first nor the third.

It expresses a higher degree of quality and compares two things. Let\\'s take some examples of regular comparative, which include positive and negative: adding \"er\" - positive: \"tall,\" negative: \"poor.\" \"Poor\" becomes \"poorer,\" and \"tall\" becomes \"taller.\" Let\\'s take a look at other examples: adding \"more\" - \"expensive\" becomes \"more expensive,\" \"important\" becomes \"more important.\" Decreased quality is usually shown by using \"less.\" Some examples are \"worthy,\" \"fortunate,\" \"less fortunate,\" \"less worthy.\" Irregular comparatives, however, change the whole word to produce comparative and superlative forms.

       " 'Here is Angel, seated on a chair with a pen. She is about to write a letter to her sister in Lagos to remind her of a wedding ceremony. She has also written another letter to her boss in Abuja to inform him of her upcoming marriage ceremony. Angel wrote her sister an informal letter, while the other was a formal letter to her employer. An informal letter is an unofficial and friendly style of writing that is written to a friend, a relative, or a close acquaintance. Informal writing allows a writer to use words that are not permitted in formal letters. Angel could remind her sister of childhood memories because they were siblings, but she couldn\\'t do that to her boss because she had to write a formal letter to him, which was strictly official. Features of informal writing include a simple structure and approach, empathy and emotions, use of personal language, and a personal tone by the writer. User-friendly salutations such as \"hello sister/brother\" and complimentary closes include \"yours sincerely\" or \"affectionately\". Always remember that informal writing applies to friends, families, and close acquaintances. See you in our next class.',\n",
       " 'We construct sentences every day, either in a verbal or written form. However, those sentences which are used daily are referred to as types of sentences. According to structure, sentences are categorized as simple sentences or compound sentences. A simple sentence contains only one clause, for example, \"I ate an egg for breakfast.\" A compound sentence contains two main clauses linked by coordinating conjunctions like \"and\" or \"but.\" Multiple sentences contain more than two main clauses linked by coordinating conjunctions. For example, \"He may do the work himself or he may ask somebody else to do it for him, but I want the work to be done.\" We also have complex sentences which contain one main clause and one or more subordinate clauses. Compound-complex sentences contain more than one main clause and one or more subordinate clauses as well. It is important to note that apart from the sentence having a subject and a predicate, a sentence may also possess five units or elements, namely subject, verb, object, complement, and adjunct (the adverbial). Be sure to construct your sentences correctly, as grammatical errors can be highly embarrassing. See you in our next class!',\n",

       " \"If you have ever seen a teacher prepare class results, you may have noticed that they first note the scores down in a book before transferring them into the report cards. Similarly, in accounting, transactions are first recorded in detail in the subsidiary books before they are posted in total in the ledger. When goods are sold on credit, purchased on credit, or returned by customers, these transactions are recorded in the appropriate subsidiary books before being taken to the ledger. Bookkeeping can be divided between several people, with different subsidiary books used to record different types of transactions. For example, a sales journal is used to record goods sold on credit, while a purchase journal is used to record goods bought on credit. When customers return goods to the business, it is recorded in the return inwards journal, and when goods are returned to the customer, it is recorded in the returns outward journal. The general journal has multiple uses, including recording opening and closing entries, fixed asset transactions, and transactions that don't fit into any other subsidiary book. When debtors fail to pay their debts, the record is cancelled in the general journal. The cash book is another subsidiary book used to record the receipts and payments of cash, while small cash payments are recorded in the petty cash book. Subsidiary books are used to record transactions before posting them to the ledger, just like a teacher records test scores before rewarding the total scores in the report card.

Every time we have something to prepare for, we obviously make sure everything we need is in the right place and we don't ignore anything important. If you're preparing a subsidiary book, you need to do a few things depending on the type of subsidiary book. For example, a purchase journal shows all goods the business bought on credit. It shows the date the goods were bought, the narration, the details, and the total amount. The sales journal, on the other hand, shows goods that are sold to customers on credit. The dates the goods were sold are shown in the first column, the narration column shows the name of the customer and the time that the goods were sold, the details column shows the price, and the total column shows the total amount the goods were sold for. In the return outwards journal, any goods that are returned to the supplier are recorded, and in the return inwards journal, the goods that customers returned are recorded. The total amount of every subsidiary book is transferred to the general ledger at the end of the month. When preparing a subsidiary book, we should be careful and make sure we record transactions in the right book. The right amount should be recorded too, and the total should be checked to avoid errors. Just like when preparing for a party, we want to make sure we have the right dress, shoes, and are sure of the time and location. Subsidiary books also need proper preparation.

       " 'Have you ever wondered why people keep things like receipts or bank tellers after transactions? Well, I was emptying the contents of my bag and I noticed I had a lot of papers. Most of them were receipts for things I had paid for long ago. It took some time, but I was able to sort them into the ones I needed and the ones I could throw away.\\n\\nWhen businesses are involved in transactions, documents like receipts, bank tellers, cheques, and others are used to show information about the transaction. These documents are called source documents and are given when transactions happen. There are different types of source documents, and they have different uses.\\n\\nA receipt is given to show payment for goods or services. An invoice, on the other hand, is the source document that the seller sends to the buyer. It shows the name and address of the buyer and seller, and it also shows what was bought, the price, and the quantity.\\n\\nAnother source document is a check. A check tells the bank to pay a sum of money to the person whose name is on the check. A bank paying-in slip is used to pay money into a bank account. It has more than one copy.\\n\\nWhen a seller mistakenly collects less money from a customer, it sends a debit note to correct it. And if the seller collects more money from the customer than it should, it sends a credit note. For example, if the customer buys goods of 25,200 and the seller makes a mistake and collects 22,500 instead, it uses a debit note to collect the balance.\\n\\nAt the end of the month, the seller can send a statement of account to their customers to show all the transactions that took place during that period. Demand receipts, bank slips, checks, and other source documents might seem like slight paper to you, but from this lesson, we can see that they all have their uses to the seller as well as the buyer.

       " \"Have you ever been asked to give an account of something? Maybe an event that happened around you, or on account of how you spent the money you were given for your birthday? You probably had to think about the answer carefully before you started, to be sure you didn't leave any important details out. \\n\\nTo you, an account tells a story or gives a description of events that took place in the past. In accounting, an account is a history of all transactions that are similar in nature. It is normal for a business to keep accounts separately for items like assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. \\n\\nA building is an asset, while a debt is a liability. Money from sales is an income, and cash paid to suppliers is an expense. An account can be personal or impersonal, based on the type of transactions recorded. Transactions between the business and persons are recorded in personal accounts. So, when a business has transactions with individuals, other businesses, and traders, it is recorded in the personal account. \\n\\nAccounts for people who hold the business's money, like debtors, and people with a business's own money, like creditors, are personal accounts. Debtors are people that buy from the business, and creditors are people who supply goods and services to the business. For example, if John buys a book from the bookshop without paying immediately, John is a debtor. If the bookshop buys books from their suppliers and agrees to pay later, the suppliers are creditors. \\n\\nIn personal accounts, there are accounts that are not personal accounts, and personal accounts deal with assets, income, and expenses. The personal accounts can be a real account or a nominal account. Physical assets or properties of the business are recorded in the real account. If a bookshop buys a van for delivering books to schools and customers, it is recorded in the real account. Furniture, land, buildings, and other assets that can be seen and touched are recorded in the real accounts. \\n\\nWhen the company makes gains or losses, they record it in the nominal account. Rents, salaries, electricity bills, and other expenses are recorded in nominal accounts. Giving an account of an event is always easier when you paid attention when the event happened. Every business should be careful when giving accounts and should understand what each type of account should contain. I hope you enjoyed this class. See you in my next class!\",\n",
       " \"In school, it is common to have separate notes for each subject. For example, you may have a math note, a biology note, and notes for other subjects. Having different notes for different subjects makes studying and learning easier. Imagine if you had just one book and you wrote all subjects in it. How would you prepare for a test? You would have to go through each page just to find where you wrote the next topic for the subjects you're studying. This sounds tiring!\\n\\nSimilarly, in business, there are a lot of accounts that cannot be kept in one ledger. To make record keeping easier, the accounts are divided among different ledgers. The same accounts are kept together, and different people can maintain the different ledgers. For example, the sales ledger is an account of all customers who bought goods on credit, also known as the debtors ledger. All accounts of creditors are recorded in the purchases or creditors ledger. The general ledger contains accounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Cash transactions are recorded in the cash book, and all private accounts are recorded in the private ledger. Dividing the ledger is important because similar accounts can be recorded together, making record keeping easier.\\n\\nIn primary school, you may have had a class teacher that taught all the subjects. However, when you got to secondary school, each subject had its own teacher. This made the work easier. There are different areas where the ledger can be divided, just like how different subjects have their own notes or teachers. Dividing the ledger makes it less confusing, just like writing topics for the same subject in separate notes. I hope you have fun in my class and see you in my next class!\",\n",
       " 'Whenever my dad gives me money, he wants me to keep a record of how I spend it. Most times, I have a note of all my transactions. The money I receive is on one side, and my expenses are on another side. I calculate my total expenses and the total money I received to be sure it is correct. In businesses, a trial balance is a list of all the balances in the ledger at a particular date. It is used to check that the records in the ledger are correct. The trial balance is used to check that the ledger records were entered correctly, and it is used as data in preparing final accounts. To prepare a trial balance, you start by balancing all the ledger accounts. Then, you put all the debit balances on the debit side of the trial balance and all the credit balances on the credit side of the trial balance. For the trial balance to agree, the debit should be equal to the credit. The trial balance is a list of just balances. This means if you have 20 ledgers, you will have 20 figures in your trial balance. For example, in your purchases ledger, you have one balance, and in your sales ledger, you have another balance. Whenever I show my dad how I spent the money he gave me, it is easy to see how I spent it on different types of expenses. A trial balance helps to show all the balances from different ledgers.

       " \"In primary school, we used pencils to correct errors we made when writing as a group. When we started using pens, erasers couldn't work anymore, so we used correction fluid instead. Erasers can change the meaning of a sentence, and they can also make calculations wrong. In business, errors can be corrected in different ways. For example, you can correct them with a razor or a corrective pen, depending on how the errors were made. A collection of errors requires journal entries, which will be posted to the ledger accounts. If the error does not affect the agreement of the trial balance, we do not use the suspense account. For example, if the debit side of the trial balance is 7,000 and the credit side is also 7,000, you do not need to use the suspense account. However, if the debit side is 7,000 and the credit side is 5,000, to correct the error, you need to use a suspense account. When you want to correct an error, you need to know some things. You have to know how the transaction is supposed to be recorded. For example, if you receive money, it is a debit entry. Then, you have to know how the transaction has been recorded. For example, you receive money and record it as a credit entry instead of a debit. The next thing to know is the type of error. Some errors do not affect the trial balance. The next thing to know is what entries you need to correct the error. It is important to remember some things. The first thing to remember is that any high time on the wrong side must be corrected by an adjustment that is twice the amount of the first error. This means if the debit is more than the credit by 1,000, to correct it, you need to add 2,000 to the credits. Not all errors affect double entries, so they do not need to be corrected by debits and credits entries. Errors can change the meaning of sentences and books of accounts. It is very important to correct the errors appropriately. I hope you had fun in my class. See you in my next class.\",\n",

However, your allowance doesn't cover the cost of books, clothes, and other more expensive items you may need. \\n\\nBusinesses also receive and pay small amounts of money. The petty cash book is a subsidiary book of accounts used for recording low-value cash payments and sometimes small cash receipts.

The petty cash book is usually maintained by a junior staff member who is given a small amount of money called a float to make small cash payments. The work of the petty cashier is checked regularly by the chief cashier. \\n\\nTo collect money from the petty cash, a petty cash voucher is used.

Eventually, it became a weekly allowance and then a monthly allowance. The allowance I received was based on how much my parents thought would be enough to cover my expenses.\\n\\nIn business, the petty cash book is maintained using the impressed system. The main cashier gives the petty cashier enough money to cover small expenses for a week or a month. The amount the petty cashier is given is called the impressed amount or the cash float, and it is a fixed amount. Any payment made from the cash float is recorded in the petty cash book. \\n\\nWhen the petty cash book is balanced at the end of the week or month, the main cashier restores the float to the normal amount. For example, if the impressed amount is 5,000 monthly and the petty cashier spends 3,500 in a month, the main cashier will have 3,500 to make the float five thousand again. This means that the petty cashier starts each month with the same amount of cash. \\n\\nThe amount of the float can be changed if the main cashier thinks it is too small or too much. The advantages of the impressed system include reducing the burden of the main cashier, helping to train young accounts clerks, accounting for all expenses, and controlling costs.

When Ada agreed to sell a box of chocolates for â‚¦5,000, she was expected to make a profit of â‚¦500 since she had gotten the box for â‚¦4,500.

If you sell it to your friend for 2500 naira, you can make a profit of 500 naira. Now, imagine if you bought boxes of chocolates, packets of sweets, and biscuits, and then sold all of them. How do you calculate your profits? A small trader is a person who owns and runs their own business. They want to know if they are making a profit or a loss from their business. To do this, they prepare final accounts. The final account of the sole trader consists of the trading account, the profit or loss account, and the statement of financial position. To know the net profit or loss, the trader prepares the profit or loss account. The net profit is obtained by adding other income and removing other expenses from the gross profit. If you had to call your friend to tell them you had a box of chocolates for sale, the money you spent to buy the card is an expense. If you spent an error to buy the card, your net profit is now 400 naira. When your other expenses are more than your gross profits, it is a net loss. Every business owner wants to make a profit. Final accounts help the business owner know if they are making a profit or a loss and to know how much the profit or loss is. Just like selling a box of chocolates at an added cost, sales must be more than the cost to make a profit. I hope you enjoyed this class. See you in my next class.',\n",
       " '```As a business owner, you expect to make a profit during high sales periods. If you buy items during these times and later decide to sell them, you should sell them for a higher price than what you paid to avoid making a loss. However, with a large inventory, it\\'s important to ensure that the money earned from selling all items is greater than the money spent on buying them. To determine gross profits or losses, a trading account is prepared. To calculate gross profits, deduct the cost of goods sold from the sales revenue. To determine the cost of goods sold, you need to know your opening and closing stock. For example, if you start with four boxes of chocolates and buy six more, you have ten boxes. If you sell seven boxes, you have three boxes left, which is your closing stock. The cost of goods sold is calculated by adding opening stock to purchases and then removing closing stock. The cost of transporting goods to the shop is called carriage inward and is added to the cost of goods sold. The trading account is usually prepared with a heading that shows the dates it covers. If you prepare your trading account for the year in December, the heading will be \"ABC Limited Trading Accounts for the Year Ended 31st December 2020.\" Every sole trader needs to prepare a trading account to determine their profits. I hope you enjoyed this lesson and see you in the next one!```',\n",
       " 'Income and expenses, profit or loss - these terms are important in any business. Everyone is interested in making additions to their pockets. You want more money for toys, games, and clothes. When you get your allowance, you can only spend on things you can afford to avoid debt. A business owner is also interested in income and needs to be sure they are not spending more than they are earning. The profit or loss account is concerned with the net profit or loss for a period, which is calculated by adding other income and removing expenses from the gross profit. The heading of the profit or loss shows the time period it covers and the name of the business. For example, if ABC Limited prepared their profit or loss statement in June, it would be titled \"ABC Statement of Profit or Loss for the Period Ended 30th June 2020\". Like the trading accounts, the profit or loss account can be prepared using the horizontal or vertical format. If you use the horizontal format, the gross profit and other income will be on the right side or credit side. Other income is obtained from sources outside the business\\'s primary activities. For example, if a supermarket makes money from selling a store or from investing, it is seen as other income. If you spend more money than you receive as an allowance, you are likely to owe a lot of money. Similarly, if a business owner has more expenses than income, they are likely to have a net loss instead of profit. I hope you enjoyed this lesson and see you in my next class!',\n",
       " 'Whenever you walk into a shop, office, or supermarket, you will notice various items. In a supermarket, you will find shelves, computers, and many items that are up for sale. In an office, you will find chairs, tables, and computers too. These items are needed by the business for its activities and are called assets. Assets are part of the business that a business is expected to record in its statement of financial position. Apart from assets, the business is also expected to record liabilities and capital. When the business borrows money or buys items on credit, it is called a liability. The money the business uses in its day-to-day activities is obtained from its capital. The business is expected to record its assets, liabilities, and capital at the end of the year using a balance sheet or the statement of financial position. So, if the supermarket owns a building, a delivery van, computers, and furniture, it will record them in these statements of financial position under assets. If the business owes money, it will record it under liabilities and record its capital too. When a business wants to prepare its statement of financial position, it lists the items it owns first and the items it has borrowed next, and the money it uses for the business last. This means that when you see a statement of financial position, the first item recorded is assets. Liabilities are recorded after assets, and the capital is recorded last. When you add your liabilities and capital together, the amount you get should be equal to your assets. For example, if all assets in ABC Limited are $20,000, the liabilities plus the capital must also be $20,000. This is because of the double-entry principle. The items owned and controlled by the business are its assets. All items in the statement of financial position are used to show the position of the business at a particular date. Next time you walk into a supermarket, office, store, or any other business, try to make a list of how many assets you can recognize. I hope you had fun in this class. See you in my next class!',\n",

In other words, a laboratory is where we prove things. \\n\\nNow, the Earth is a laboratory because it is where human existence is proven. All human activities, living and non-living things, exist and can be proven as real by the activities or non-activities carried out on the Earth. The study of all these activities in different locations such as agriculture, mining, fishing, trading, manufacturing, and construction, as well as physical things within the Earth such as rocks, mountains, plains, oceans, rivers, climates, vegetation, soils, atmosphere, and so on, is called geography. \\n\\nThe word geography is derived from two Greek words, \"geo\" and \"graph,\" which means \"description of the Earth.\" Therefore, geography is a social science subject that deals with the study of man and his activities within his environment.

We draw those lines to help us understand the concept of longitude. So, what is longitude? Longitude is an angular distance measured in degrees east and west of the Greenwich Meridian. The Greenwich Meridian is an imaginary line drawn on the globe, running from the north to the south at a right angle to the parallels.

In fact, the big rocks are few compared to the mass number of rocks available in our environment. Rocks differ from one another. Some rocks can be very big, while others not so big and can be as small as stones and pebbles. Rocks can even be differentiated. Of course, this is because rocks differ in texture, structure, color, permeability, mode of occurrence, and degree of resistance to denotation. So, all the rocks in our environment can be classified into three different types based on their origin or mode of formation and appearance. These types are igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks, and metamorphic rocks. Trust your heart for learning in this lesson. See you in the next lesson. Bye!',\n",

Slowly, the liquid drops and begins to solidify to become wax as it gets cold. Have you ever observed this properly? Great! This is similar to how igneous rocks are formed. Igneous rocks are formed from a hot liquid substance called molten magma. Molten magma is formed when there is high temperature and pressure from beneath the Earth's crust. The Earth's surface cracks and a molten substance is forced out of the Earth's crust like a fountain of water. This molten substance is the molten magma. As this molten moves towards the Earth's surface, the temperature becomes cooler and solidifies to form igneous rocks. So, igneous rocks are rocks that are formed by the cooling and solidification of molten magma. Trust me, you will learn a lot in this lesson. See you in the next lesson. Bye!\",\n",

It is an example of igneous rock, and every other type of igneous rock is just like granite. So, the characteristics of igneous rocks include the following: they are crystalline in structure, that is, they contain crystals; they do not occur in layers or strata; they do not contain fossils; they are usually hard and impervious; they are resistant to erosion and other elements of climate.

As the liquid becomes cool, it solidifies again. This same thing happens in the Earth's crust. From solid rocks under the Earth's crust that have melted into more thin magma due to hot temperature, magma erupts and cools on the Earth's surface to form igneous rocks. But do you know that the temperature on the Earth's surface is not stable? So, when molten magma gets to the Earth's surface, it may cool off very fast or cool up slowly. When it cools very fast, the type of igneous rock formed is called volcanic igneous rock. But when it cools very slowly, plutonic igneous rocks are formed. So, there are two types of igneous rock based on their formation, which are volcanic (also extrusive igneous rock) and plutonic (also intrusive igneous rock). Examples of volcanic igneous rocks are granites, gabbro, and diorites. An example of plutonic igneous rock is basalt. Trust this lesson for learning and see you in the next lesson. Bye!\",\n",

Sedimentary rocks are types of rocks that are formed by the accumulation or deposition of mineral or organic particles at the earth's surface. This process is known as sedimentation. Sedimentation is a collective name for processes that cause these particles to settle in place. Let's describe this process in detail. When a rock breaks down into small fragments or sediments, the fragments are transported and deposited by factors like water and wind. These loose sediments compress and harden over the years to form layers of rocks. Trust your heart for learning in this lesson. See you in the next lesson. Bye!\",\n",

Coal and petroleum are also examples of sedimentary rocks, as they are formed from the remains of living things like animals and plants. The characteristics of sedimentary rocks include being coarse, fine, soft, or hard, containing fossils of plants and animals, being resistant to erosion, and having many layers due to the deposition of sediments.

When a river flows, it carries along pieces of broken rocks with it. So, what happens when these pieces reach the lake or the sea? All of the rocks settle at the bottom to form sediments. This is how sedimentary rocks are formed. Sedimentary rocks are formed when sediments are deposited by wind, gravity, or water flows carrying the particles in suspension.

That's how mechanically formed sedimentary rocks are formed. \\n\\nMechanically formed sedimentary rocks are rocks formed by the breaking up of residue of rocks into pieces. These smaller pieces are just like the bigger rock. The rock has been changed physically but retains its composition. These small fragments result from the weathering of rocks.

Eventually, when the water dries, the pan will be coated with the same salt that was originally dissolved in the water. This is exactly what happens in nature when ice and water in seas evaporate, leaving behind dissolved minerals. Chemical sedimentary rocks are formed by the evaporation or precipitation of dissolved minerals from oceans and lakes.

       " 'Daniel woke up feeling very hot and weak, unable to stand on his own. He went to the hospital where I am currently located. The nurse used an instrument to test his body temperature, which I had never seen before. This instrument is called a thermometer. A thermometer is used to measure temperature and has a narrow glass tube filled with a liquid substance called mercury. Mercury is a metal that can expand when heated and contract when cooled. When the thermometer comes in contact with a hot body, the mercury expands and gives a reading to determine how hot or cold the body is. This same instrument is used to measure atmospheric temperature to determine how hot or cold the atmosphere of a place is. The thermometer is commonly measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit scale. With the aid of the thermometer, we can determine the months with the highest and lowest temperatures in a year, the annual range of temperature, anal temperature, and mean annual temperature in a year. I hope you enjoyed learning about thermometers in this lesson. See you in the next lesson. Bye!',\n",
       " '\"What about wind? When hair is in motion, we still cannot see it. Did you know that sometimes wind can move so fast that it carries sand, dust, and stones, and can even destroy things in its path? Every year, the people of Kataman village experience a period of wind turbulence towards the north. However, because wind cannot be seen, it is difficult for them to know when this will happen and protect their lives and property. The people of this village asked for the government\\'s help, and the government promised to assist them by using two instruments to measure the direction and speed of wind. The people of Carmelton village were very happy. The two instruments are the wind vane, which measures the direction of wind, and the anemometer, which measures the speed of wind. When these two instruments are exposed to the wind, the speed and direction of wind can be determined. We hope you enjoyed learning in this lesson. See you in the next one. Bye!\"',\n",
       " \"Wow, there have been lights from the bulb and I've been in the dark for so long. But when I turned on the switch, I was finally able to see. Did you know that this bulb is able to supply the room with light because of electricity? The sun is a major source of light on Earth, but it has a set time to rise and set. So at night, we are left with no source of light. This was a problem that needed to be solved. Man, through the knowledge of science, devised a means to generate what is called electricity. But the light problem was not the only issue that needed to be solved. Electricity can be used to achieve so many things. With it, we can light our homes, charge devices like phones and laptops, use fans and air conditioners to prevent heat, and operate kitchen equipment like electric cookers, boilers, grinders, fridges for cooling and preserving food, and even use pressing irons. I'm sure you must have used one of these devices before. So, what is electricity and how is it generated? We'll answer this question in our next class. I hope you enjoyed this class. See you in the next lesson. Bye!\",\n",
       " \"Hi there! In our last lesson, we learned about power resources and how humans have been able to solve problems related to light by generating electricity. Do you remember that we also discussed how electricity is used to power various devices in our homes? Now, let's explore how electricity is used in industries. Did you know that many machines used in industries are powered by electricity? This includes ATMs, heavy industrial machines used for production, hospital equipment, scanners, and even transportation and communication devices in the aviation industry. As you can see, electricity plays a crucial role in our daily lives. Power resources refer to the means by which electricity is generated. In Nigeria, electricity is generated from four sources: water through hydroelectric power generation, coal, petroleum, and natural gas. I hope you now have a better understanding of electricity and its importance. In our next lesson, we will delve deeper into how power is generated. See you then! Goodbye.\",\n",
       " \"Oh no, it looks like it's about to rain. I should find some cover quickly. Wow, the rain is really heavy and it's causing flooding everywhere. Have you ever thought about the river on the other side of the road? The government recently built a dam over it, so whenever there's heavy rainfall, the river floods. All the drainage gutters and canals lead to this river, so sediments carried by the flood are deposited in the dam. But what happens during times of climate change when there's no rainfall? The sun shines so bright that water evaporates, causing a decrease in the volume of water in the dam. This means there won't be enough water in the reservoir to generate electricity. So, whether it's during wet or dry seasons, climate has an effect on the dam. Let's explore the effects of climate on the dam. Inadequate rainfall reduces the volume of water in the river or dam. Excessive rainfall leads to overflow of water from the dam. High intensity of rainfall leads to sedimentation of silts in dams. Intensive heat also leads to high evaporation of water from dams. These effects determine the volume of water available in the dam for it to function properly. I hope you learned something new today. See you in the next lesson! Goodbye.\",\n",
       " \"Foreign, do you know what a dam is? It can also be called a hydroelectric power plant. This is where electricity is generated from water. So, how does a dam work? Dams are built over rivers and waterfalls where there is a large volume of water and a wall holding the water back. A dam needs an abundant supply of water and an elevation to drop it from, so it creates a reservoir which stores water until it's ready to use. The water is used to give turbines energy. But what is a turbine? A turbine is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator. Typically, the turbine is commonly attached to an electrical generator or is used for other work like turning a ship propeller. \\n\\nWell, there's a generating system and the water, when released, enters the generating system through a series of giant pipes. Then, it travels through a steep pipe creating a massive column of water with a huge force. The water passes through a turbine, and the force of the water forces this giant blade to rotate the turbine, which is connected to a large generator that converts the mechanical energy into electricity. The electricity generated then travels through high voltage wires to transformers and onto transmission towers. From here, the electric energy is transmitted and distributed for use. \\n\\nHydroelectric power or hydroelectricity is a form of energy that harnesses the power of water in motion, such as power flowing over a waterfall, to generate electricity. Did you know that hydroelectric energy is the most commonly used renewable source of electricity in the world? These dams built to generate hydroelectric energy are usually very big projects costing huge amounts of money. So, where can we find examples of these big power projects in Nigeria? Examples of hydroelectric projects in Nigeria are found in Kanji Dam on River Niger and Shiroro Dam on River Kaduna. Hydroelectric power is a sustainable, simple, and clean way to generate sustainable amounts of power. Now you have a better understanding of how electricity is generated. See you in the next lesson. Bye, Foreign!\",\n",
       " \"Do you think that the only means by which electricity is generated is from water? Well, there are other means by which electricity is generated. If you recall what we learned from how water is used to generate electricity, the moving water from the dam creates a force that causes the blade of a turbine to spin. So, scientists came together and asked a question: what can we use instead of water or what else can generate the same amount of force? Guess what they found out? They found out that when water is heated into steam and directed across the blades of a turbine, enough force is generated to cause the turbine to spin. Wow, isn't it amazing that steam and water do the same? I am surprised too! If water is to be heated, then fuel is needed, right? So, the next question is, how do we get the amount of fuel for such a huge project? Some of the more common fuels are natural gas, coal, uranium (which is also known as nuclear), diesel oil, and biomass materials. So, any of these common fuels can be used to heat up water to steam. \\n\\nIf electricity energy generated from water is called hydroelectric, what can we call energy generated from steam? Don't think too far because it is generated from heat. We can call it thermal power. So, from what we have learned so far, we can say that thermal power or thermal electricity is power or electricity generated through the use of coal, natural gas, and petroleum. These minerals are used to power turbines or giant generators in order to generate electricity. \\n\\nLet's see how this works too. Water is generated into steam and directed across the blades of a turbine, and enough force is generated to cause the turbine to spin. After passing through the turbine, the steam is cooled and condensed back into liquid form before being returned to the heat source where it will again be converted into steam. Power plants use a wide range of fuels to heat liquids into steam. Most thermal plants are large industrial installations used to generate electricity. \\n\\nI believe you enjoyed this lesson. See you in the next lesson. Bye!\",\n",
       " '\"When something goes wrong, who do we blame? After Peter applied to study political science at Yale for four years and still can\\'t seem to find a job three years after graduation, who do we hold accountable? As citizens, we expect our government to provide certain things to make life easier. For example, I want to enjoy constant electricity, our aging parents and grandparents want a good healthcare system, and our neighbors want good motorable roads. All these requests are often directed towards the government. When a group of people come together for the purpose of coexisting and there is a need to make certain decisions, the representatives making those decisions could be likened to the government. This is because the government makes decisions for the state. Regardless of the country you are in, whether it\\'s America, Poland, or Singapore, they all have an organized body called the government. There is no country on the global map without a government. It might be organized, just like in developed countries, or disorganized, like in third world countries. When you look at these countries, you observe that there are similarities in the operations of their respective governments. First, every country has a constitution that states how it could operate. In Nigeria, it is the 1999 constitution, and in the United States of America, it is the 1992 amended constitution. In 2021, Americans voted for Joe Biden to replace Donald Trump through the election. Election and periodic change are silent features of a government all over the world. Therefore, we can deduce that the government is an institution of the state and an academic field of study.\"',\n",

Paul believed that Jonathan would win, while his uncle predicted Goodluck. Paul's knowledge of government allowed him to confidently explain why he thought Jonathan would win, and as it turned out, Jonathan did become the president. This highlights the importance of studying government, as it allows us to uncover truths and discover facts that we may not have known otherwise. By understanding government, we can better understand our rights and hold our leaders accountable. The ability to make accurate predictions, like Paul did, is just one of the many benefits of studying government.

Although the terms \"state\" and \"country\" are often used interchangeably, the word \"state\" can be traced back to the German tribes who initially called it \"status.\" We all belong to a state, which is a union of people living in a defined territory. For example, the people of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland came together to form the United Kingdom. A state is a geographical territory with a defined population and an organized body of government that enjoys sovereignty. To be called a state, a place must possess certain features, such as a permanent population and a government. Brazil is an example of a state, with citizens, a president, and a recognized identity. The USA is another example of a state. In summary, a state is a union of diverse people under one umbrella.',\n",

The farmer has a relationship with his farmland, just like how a person has a relationship with their property. Similarly, the government and the state have a relationship. The government operates within the state. Have you ever thought about how this is possible or what it means? When we have a state, we have a government. The implication of this is that a state cannot exist without a body of government. On the other hand, a government cannot exist without a state. For instance, the office of the President of the United States of America wouldn\\'t be available without the existence of America. The state and government are hugely interconnected. Now that we know the relationship between the state and government, we can move on to the relationship between the state and nation. Firstly, we need to know that a nation is made up of people with a common culture, background, or descent. While the state, as we know it, encompasses a wide array of diverse cultural backgrounds and beliefs. What about the relationship between the state and society? In clear terms, the state is a composition of a number of societies. That is, the state has a wider scope than society. Society simply makes up the state.',\n",

The other day, she was out skipping rope with her friends and she heard what sounded like the horn of her dad's car. She ran so fast to get home before him. Everyone always wondered why Elizabeth was so scared of her dad. It wasn't until recently that it dawned on us that Elizabeth's dad would spank her when she fails to do what he's asked of her. Elizabeth's dad simply had power over his daughter. Power is the ability to influence the behaviors of others to suit one's will. It is simply the ability to make someone do what ordinarily they wouldn't do. Just because Elizabeth is scared of her dad, she would listen and adhere to everything he tells her. She would not play football outside, go on an errand, or dare say no. Elizabeth was scared of the sanction that would come to her if she fails to adhere. We have been talking about power. How do people come about their power? There are various sources of power, including physical power, social norms, ideas, and numbers. Power is not only used in father and daughter relationships like we have with Elizabeth and her dad. However, in our schools and society at large, we see the use of power. You can easily find a muscular person beating up a skinnier one or a thug extracting money from people. Aside from the kind of power exercised by Elizabeth's dad on her, we also have charismatic power, coercive power, legitimate power, amongst many others.

For instance, if the government wants to increase the value of added tax on the sales of video games, people will be asked to vote in favor or against such a motion. If there are more yeses than noes, then the government would impose the tax, and if there are more noes than yeses, then the government stops such policies. \\n\\nIndirect democracy, on the other hand, is when people vote in representatives to make decisions on their behalf. Indirect democracy is what we have today, voting in senators who make decisions in our state is an example of indirect democracy.

From chocolates like Snickers, Bounty, and Smarties to deciding which store to shop at, such as Walmart, Target, Kroger, or Costco, the choices seem endless. This abundance of options is made possible by capitalism, which allows individuals the freedom to own and control different stores. If you have the means to set up a phone store, flower shop, or chocolate store, you have the freedom to do so. However, in capitalism, there is competition for control of the market. For example, in Nigeria, there are many pasta producing industries like Dangote and Golden Penny, and they compete to dominate the market.

Instead, the government decides which essential goods and services to provide. Imagine if the United States of America practiced socialism, do you think the Walton family, who owns Walmart, would be as successful and rich as they are now? When discussing socialism, it's hard not to reference Karl Marx. Socialism is a reaction to the inequality created by capitalism. It implies that the government owns societal resources and controls every means of production, and everyone is given the essentials they need. Imagine socialism as a situation where you own two cows, but the government takes one from you and gives it to your neighbor so that you and your neighbor are equal. This is what socialism aims to do - close the gap between the rich and the poor and eliminate the rich getting richer and the power model we have in capitalism. Similarly, socialism is simply the government owning a factory, such as a bread or water production factory, and employing people to work there, paying them based on what each of them needs. In a socialist society, education and healthcare services are often free or charged at little or no cost. Socialism is a political and economic model that advocates for the means of production, distribution, and exchange to be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.

Today's lesson taught us that a political party is the channel through which a person can be elected to a political office or power. See you in the next class!\",\n",
       " \"Can you identify the man in the picture? He is Kim Jong-un, the supreme leader of North Korea and the leader of the Workers' Party. North Korea operates a one-party system, meaning that only one political party, the Workers' Party, is legally recognized to compete for votes and present candidates for election. Examples of countries that practice a one-party system include North Korea, Cuba, China, Kenya, and others. However, many people are unaware that there are actually three types of one-party systems. The first is a single-party system, which prevents the formation of any other active parties. The second is a dominant-party system, in which one party enjoys unchallenged authority and the law does not operate formally against any opposition. The third type is a predominant-party system, in which a party is elected and continues to be elected. Now that you know about the different types of one-party systems, I hope to see you in my next class.\",\n",
       " \"Can you name any other political party in Nigeria apart from APC or PDP? It's difficult for some people in Nigeria because of the popularity of APC and PDP. Nigeria runs a two-party system. What is a two-party system? A two-party system is an arrangement in which only two political parties are recognized to contest for elected posts. Examples of countries that practice a two-party system are the United States, where they have the Republican and Democratic parties which are dominant, and Britain, where they have the Labour and Conservative parties. Let's take a look at some of the characteristics of a two-party system. There is no room for another contesting party. It limits press freedom. It may not accommodate democratic principles and may allow oppression of the rule of law, where everyone is equal before the law. See you in my next class!\",\n",
       " 'Did you know that Nigeria has a multi-party system, which means that there are several political parties apart from APC and PDP, such as PPA, KOWA Party, APGA, and more? In a multi-party system, each party produces a reasonable and good candidate to be elected into government. This allows parties like APGA, PPA, and KOWA Party to exist while producing their candidates for election. Identifying a multi-party system is easy because it allows the existence of many parties, gives legal recognition to all political parties, allows an easy choice of individual parties and programs, and enhances political education. We have learned that parties like APGA, PPA, and KOWA Party reflect a multi-party system where each party exists while producing candidates for election. See you in my next class!',\n",

This system has some interesting benefits, including proper management of time, discouraging electoral malpractice, and cost reduction. However, a zero-party system may also not be beneficial because it may lead to political instability and an absence of a political manifesto.',\n",

The women's protection center is a pressure group that helps victims of rape get justice. Pressure groups like the women's protection center protect or advance a particular cause. Some of these pressure groups are gender pressure groups, economic professional pressure groups, or ethnic or cultural pressure groups, etc. In order for these groups to be effective, they must have some important factors. One of them is the existence of a high degree of dedication and unity, as well as the supply of adequate funds and the relevance of its aims and objectives. This means that there must be a proper understanding of what the pressure group is all about. The people described at the beginning of the text understood that the women's protection center could get justice for the raped girl, so they took her there for justice.

Pressure groups, which are like-minded individuals coming together with a view to advance a course, can have some enemies which are referred to as factors working against their success. Some of those factors include political culture and opposing groups. Political culture refers to the extent to which pressure group activity is regarded as legitimate. In other words, a pressure group that is not considered to be politically correct may be subject to threats. Opposing groups may cancel each other out or reduce the impact of each other's activities. For instance, there are some people who support the hunting of animals while others believe that animals are not to be killed but protected. In their quest for a particular cause, pressure groups pose some dangers such as being biased in favor of their interests. Additionally, committed members of pressure groups may need to do dangerous things. Furthermore, opinions held by pressure groups may only help a small minority of the population.

Nigeria was not always this big and did not exist until 1914. Before 1940, Nigeria was just a collection of people with different ethnic groups. However, these different ethnic groups came together in 1914 through the British. The British used the interaction and bond between the different ethnic groups to form this nation. Now, we have a nation with about 200 million people with different ethnic groups like Europe, Yoruba, Igbo, Idoma, and Hausa. Nigeria has more than what meets the eye. It is said to be the richest country in tropical Africa with a gross national product of over one billion dollars. If you are looking for a real billionaire, it is our beloved nation.

As we passed through each region, Mambi explained to me the characteristics of each region. We came across the coastal region, which spanned from where I stayed (for example, Lagos) to Calibre. The coastal region was a long piece of lowland that had features like lagoons, creeks, and the Niger Delta. However, I couldn't help but notice that there were more trees in some parts. Mambi explained to me that these parts were the forest region, and it was so because there's heavy rainfall in this region. I also saw the semi-savanna region, where there were trees and tall grasses. Mambi explained that this was so because the region was between the forest region and savannah. The savannah was a sight to see. It was an open woodland grassland that made it easier for horses to move on while touring. I saw that the crops that grew in the savannah were different from those that grew in the forest zone. I also got to see that geography, which is characterized by the physical features of the place, had a lot of effect not only on the livelihood but also on the transportation system of the people of Nigeria.

The people then migrated from Mecca to live there, and they spread all over Yoruba land. The Hausa people also have a similar legend, which originated from Bayajida, who came from the royal house of Bagauda. Bayajida killed a snake in Daura and married the queen, who bore him a son named Bawo. Bawo then gave birth to seven sons who established the seven Hausa states.

However, people also participated in other activities such as trading, hunting, fishing, and manufacturing. Speaking of manufacturing, what are the different types of industries? One of them is pottery. If you have seen a clay cup molded in school, then you have an idea of what pottery is. Pottery involves the production of items using clay, such as water fetching pots, plates, and bowls. Another industry is metal work, which includes iron technology, bronze, and brass. Iron technology refers to mining the ore, smelting, and smithing. Knives are a result of iron technology, while bronze and brass are used in casting heads and figures, as well as decorating the oba's palace. Salt production is another industry that helps in preservation, cooking, and is even used as currency.

       " \"It is important to remember that before the Portuguese arrived in Nigeria in the 15th century, there were Arab traders who came through the Sahara desert and other parts of North Africa. By the mid-15th century, it was common to find Portuguese traders in some coastal areas of Nigeria. Coastal areas are the regions that are near or around the sea. There are about eight coastal states in Nigeria, including Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Lagos, Ondo, and Rivers, bordering the Atlantic Ocean. The Portuguese arrived in West Africa through the coast of Guinea and in Nigeria through the coast around Bini and Delta regions. Like people who go to the market, there were several reasons for their arrival. We can categorize the main reasons why the Portuguese came to Nigeria into three headings: commercial or research motives, religious or missionary motives, and explorational motives. \\n\\nAt the beginning of the Portuguese penetration of West Africa, especially in Nigeria, there was also the Renaissance in Europe and America. The Renaissance was the age of exploration, research, and reformation. The activities of the Arab and West African traders, especially in Nigeria, became more popular in Europe as they heard about the availability of raw materials and manpower. Most Europeans who knew how to navigate the sea and sail for days and even months wanted to be a part of the exploration. In those days in Europe, it was about glory, fame, God, and expansion. \\n\\nWe should also remember that the slave trade between the Arabs and the paths they traveled in Nigeria was thriving. So, most of the Portuguese who came to Nigeria also came to trade, educate by slave, and spread their gospel. It was this set of Portuguese that stabilized transatlantic slave trade. For instance, the first known slave raid in Nigeria happened around 1443, and one of the first groups of people to become involved in the transatlantic slave trade were the Jaws, as we mentioned earlier. Although slave trade became very normal, and the activities of Portuguese in Nigeria's coast became more frequent, there were also some Portuguese who came to Nigeria because of their intention to spread the gospel. To them, God was not in support of either Islam or traditional African belief. It was this set of Portuguese who started missionary schools, built churches, and abolished most cruel cultures in some Nigerian places. \\n\\nBefore now, it was true that some parts of Nigeria practiced cannibalism and even killed twins. There were also those who came to explore, have fun, and experience life different from what they were used to in Europe. On their return, they loved and enjoyed telling stories about how they walked almost naked, how they taught some of the people they met on the way how to read in English, slept on mats with clay plates, went to hunt, saw animals, and watched their native doctors perform mutual functions.

Slavery and slave trade existed in Africa before the Europeans came, particularly in West Africa. Slavery originated as a form of punishment, capture of war, kidnapping, and so on. How did the transatlantic slave trade begin? The Portuguese started it in 1441. Portuguese conservatives took 10 slaves to Portugal. How was the slave trade organized? The transatlantic slave trade was made easy through special ships designed to carry slaves. The Royal Niger Company was established to control the trade, and the adoption of a trust system led to evil effects such as the population of Africa collapsing and some forests being destroyed.

       " \"Islam, which means total submission to the will of Allah, was preached and spread by Prophet Muhammad in Arabia. It was these same Arabs who brought the Islamic religion to Nigeria, penetrating through the Kanem-Bornu Empire in modern-day Borno State of Nigeria. It is important to mention that by the end of the 1800s, Islam had gradually reached the stage where there were different breeds of Muslim scholars, all preaching for Prophet Muhammad but advocating for reforms of the practice of Islam, which they felt would make society better. It was this reform that led to the establishment of the Sokoto Caliphate and consolidated the position of Islam in northern Nigeria. At this point, Islam became the official religion of the region, and the cities under the Sokoto Caliphate's supply interpreted and enforced the law and influenced the people in all the ways they made their decisions. In no time, they started to spread through the southern part of Nigeria. In the 19th century, Islam was consolidated and fully accepted, but it was already present in the western part of Nigeria before the 1800s. However, they had a weak position as they were scattered around without major political or social status. Many historians believe that the spread of Islam in the 19th century and beyond was due to the influence of the liberated Muslim slaves who came back to Nigeria. Although most of them were Christians, a good number of Muslims also came back with many of the skills they learned as slaves. They easily made money and were quick to support the growth and development of the Islamic movement, especially in the western and hinterlands of Nigeria. As society became more stabilized and more of the slaves stayed back, the Muslims began to reconstitute themselves to form Islamic communities. They made moves to secure open-air spaces for their group prayers and tried to build more mosques and places they could secure. At this point, it was easy to get a position as an Islamic leader. The major prerequisites, especially in the south and west, were a commitment to study the Quran. Muslims all over received help and support as much as possible from the caliphates and leaders from both Kanem and Bornu. They always tried to lead by example and also tried to be available for the growing population in the south and other western parts. After the holy war in 1804, there was a spread of Islam in leaps and bounds, even outside the north, through places like Auchi, Afeme, and other places in southern Nigeria. The expansion in Yoruba land became very fast, first in the major abandoned centers like Abeokuta and later to the neighboring towns and villages. There are several reasons to explain the rapid spread of Islam in the 1800s. First was the jihad of Usman Danfodio of 1804, then the strategies of Islamic agents whose jobs were to preach to conventional families, towns, and cities. The support of traditional rulers and the roles of the malams in Islam. The marlins or the alpha is considered a man of God, preaching scholar, teacher, trader, advisor, and even the spiritual medicine man. Some historians agree that Islam brought about literacy and the study of Arabic, which enticed people in those periods to join them.\",\n",
       " 'Look at Taofiq talking to Musa. I wonder what they are discussing. Musa is a cleric and teacher in the mosque. He educates his students about Islam. Jihad is an Islamic or Arabic term that means an effort or struggle. It is also seen as a war of faith against unbelievers. One of the popular movements of jihad, apart from Usman Dan Fodio, was Sekou Ahmadu. Sekou was born in 1775 and studied under Usman Dan Fodio. He was supported by Usman and was known to declare jihad in Hamdullahi and conquered other places like Jenny. Another person who declared a jihad movement was Al-Hajj Umar. Umar was born in 1794. He went to Mecca and joined the Tijania brotherhood. He declared jihad in Digware in 1852. Did you know that he also set up a Muslim state called the Segu Tukula Empire? Mohammed El-Khanimi was another person who declared a jihad movement. He was born in 1774 to Kanuri parents. He later became the Shehu of Borno. The Muslim brotherhoods are Qadiriyya, Tijaniyya, and Muridiyya. I hope you had an insightful class today and learned something very interesting. See you next time!',\n",

After the death of Dan a laughing of Oyo Alafin Abiyondu, there were a series of unending quarrels between the provincial chiefs on different issues. Most of these quarrels were on minor issues, but because most of the provincial chiefs were driven by greed, they became a full-blown conflict.

The Ibadan war boys raided constantly for slaves and delayed the Fulani penetration. \\n\\nAs Ibadan continued to grow, the fear that it may dominate the Euroba land brought about more wars and alliances, such as the advanced city of Abelcota.

It involved a Kitty Egesha Anife who formed an alliance called Ekiti Parapo against Ibadan. War broke out in 1877 when Ibadan tried to break Jebu and Igba control over the trade route. A peace treaty was signed, initiated by the British in 186, which recognized the independence of Akt Paracore aliens. War broke out again in 1890 but was brought to an end by the British military intervention in 1992 to 1993. It was all these squabbles that weakened the central authority of the Oyo Empire and gave rise to regional autonomy. It was these wars that led to the creation of new states like Ibadan and Ijaye and also saw the rise and fall of some of the most influential figures in urban history. It caused the weakness of the Oyo sovereignty over the area, which eventually led to the British annexation in the late 19th century, pretending to want to end the slave trade. Wow, we have had so much land. In our next class, we will be talking about European explorers.',\n",
       " 'Do you know the difference between war, conflict, quarrel, or fight? Have you heard of the First or Second World War? What were they about? The First and Second World Wars involved almost every nation in the world. It was a period of mass destruction of both lives and properties. Every war is intended to kill, destroy, or defeat an opponent. There are several factors that cause people to go to war. Everywhere in the world, people fight and have misunderstandings because of different reasons. War can be said to be part of the human condition as it has existed since the beginning of the world. Most nations of the world have had some form of civil war or another. For instance, in Nigeria, there have been many wars, riots, and conflicts. Of all the wars we have had in Nigeria, the most common and easily remembered is the Nigerian Civil War, otherwise known as the Nigeria-Biafra War. It was a war fought for about three years, from 1967 to 1970. The Nigerian Civil War, like every other war, has caused a lot of reasons, which included the desire for the Igbo nation to separate from Nigeria and have a country of their own. In the pre-colonial times, most of the reasons why people went to war were economic. People, nations, or kingdoms went to war with other kingdoms to improve the economy of their own kingdom. They did this by capturing slaves to sell or make them work tirelessly in their farms, exploiting natural resources, and asking for tributes, which were a particular percentage of all food products of that kingdom to be sent to the waning kingdom. Some other people went to war for territorial expansion. For instance, when two countries or kingdoms fought for boundaries, a country who believed they were stronger than their neighbors could start a war to seize the land by force. In those days, this was the major way kings got their wealth, respect, and territorial expansion. Before any major agreement, nations would fight and kill, and then when they surrendered, they became subjects of the other nation. Some other people went to war because of nationalism, religion, or even revenge. Like the Nigerian Civil War, many historians have agreed that religion and the unfair treatment of the Igbos in most northern states of Nigeria at that time were major reasons for the war. Another reason could be the quest for power. As we know, power has to do with the ability to influence or command respect and control people. Kings who wanted more respect would go to war to show other nations what they could do. In Nigeria, for instance, during the Civil War in 1960, there was a fight by the Igbos to control the lucrative oil-producing state because oil was a commodity that was needed everywhere in the world. In summary, war is usually an intense armed conflict between governments, states, and societies. When people argue and quarrel, it can be said that there was a misunderstanding. But when people, countries, organizations, or states quarrel and take to violence using weapons aimed to kill or destroy and open it, it can be referred to as war.',\n",
       " 'Hello and welcome to your first Literature in English class. Before we dive into the subject matter, it\\'s important to lay a proper foundation. We\\'ll start by defining English Literature and Literature in English. Although they may sound similar, they are not the same. In fact, there are four key differences.\\n\\nHave you ever had bean cake and bean balls? They may look and taste similar, but they are not the same. The same analogy applies to English Literature and Literature in English. While both are English in nature, they differ in several ways.\\n\\nLiterature refers to the entire collection of written works from all over the world. If categorized by language, we have French Literature, American Literature, English Literature, and so on. If categorized by period, we have Old Literature, Classical Literature, Modern Literature, and more. If categorized by geographical location, we have Western Literature, Eastern Literature, Southern Asian Literature, and so on.\\n\\nEnglish Literature, on the other hand, encompasses literature written not only in England but also in Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and British colonies, including the United States of America. Examples of such literature include prose, drama, poetry, and essays. Writers like William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, William Blake, T.S. Eliot, and Mark Twain are considered writers of English Literature.\\n\\nLiterature in English, on the other hand, refers to any written work translated into the English language. For example, \"Ogbojo\" is a prose originally written in Yoruba by D.O. Fagongwa. It was translated into \"A Forest of Thousand Demons\" by Wale Oshun. \"The Three Musketeers\" was written by a French author called Alexandre Dumas and was translated into English by several translators. These literary works are known as Literature in English.\\n\\nTo simplify, here are three key differences between English Literature and Literature in English. First, English Literature refers to literary works written in the English language, while Literature in English refers to any literary work translated into English. Second, English Literature is written only in English, while Literature in English is written in other languages but translated into English. Third, English Literature reflects English culture, while Literature in English reflects other cultures.\\n\\nAlthough they may be made from the same ingredients, English Literature and Literature in English do not taste the same. I hope you enjoyed this class, and I\\'ll see you next time. Cheers!',\n",
       " '```Hello and welcome to the Literature in English class. Last time, we learned about the meaning of literature, English literature, and literature in English. Today, we will be discussing the purpose of literature in simple words. It is important to note that understanding the purpose of literature is an essential part of this subject. As a wise person once said, \"If the purpose of a thing is not known, abuse is imminent.\" To appreciate literature in English, you need to understand its purpose so that you can put it to good use. \\n\\nSo, why study literature in English? You may remember reading stories like \"A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream\" by William Shakespeare in your junior secondary school English language class. At the time, you probably just paid attention to the story as a whole. Now that you are in senior secondary school and taking literature in English classes, you will consider various aspects of the stories, dramas, and other literary works. By doing so, literature in English helps you to follow up on the literary skills you acquired during your junior secondary school education. Skills like writing, reading, and comprehension will be improved. \\n\\nAdditionally, you will be exposed to other societies separate from your own through the novels, dramas, and poetry you will study. As you read these literary pieces, your sense of judgment and thinking will be developed. These are some of the purposes of studying literature in English. I\\'ll see you in the next class!```',\n",
       " '\"Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, and so are you.\" Welcome to another Literature in English class! Did you enjoy that poem? Today, we will be discussing poetry - one of the major genres of literature. A genre refers to a style, kind, or category. According to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, two literary giants in the world of English literature, poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotions recollected in tranquility. Just like the poem I recited, you must always remember that to write poetry, your state of mind is important. Your words must carry emotion, just like the words of my poem. Another thing to note about poetry is that although it comes in many forms, it has general characteristics. For example, it is written in lines that have meter and rhythm. You can see how the lines of this poem have the same length and rhythm. These lines are put together to form stanzas, in contrast to other writings that utilize sentences that are divided into paragraphs. Poetry often relies heavily on figurative language, such as metaphors and similes, to convey meanings and create images for the reader. In my poem, you can see how I compare the subject of my poem to flowers and sugar, thereby making it colorful and emotional.',\n",
       " 'In the last class, we looked at the major characteristics of poetry. Today, we will talk about the different types of poetry or poems. I remember Sarah, let me tell you about her. Sarah is a writer and even a poet. She enjoys writing poems for events like birthdays, burials, and all sorts of ceremonies. She had recently worked on a 14-line poem. When you ask her what she did, she will tell you it is a sonnet. A sonnet is a type of poem that has one stanza for ten-line poem written in iambic pentameter, meaning a line of 10 syllables with alternate stressed and unstressed syllables according to iambic rhythm. An example of such a poem is Sonnet 18 written by William Shakespeare or \"Death Be Not Proud\" by John Doan. \\n\\nJust like we have sonnets, we also have other types of poems. We have elegy, ballad, and so on. What is an ode? It is a poem meant to be sung. That\\'s why it is also known as a lyrical poem. It addresses a particular subject and is written in varied or irregular meter. An example is John Keats\\' \"Ode on a Grecian Urn.\" An elegy or dirge is a sad or mindful poem often recited for the dead at a funeral. An example is \"Adonais\" written in 1822 by Percy Bysshe Shelley for John Keats, a poet who died. \\n\\nAn epic is a lengthy narrative poem written about a serious subject for the praising of his or her its heroic deeds or the events of the significance of a culture or nation. An example is \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey.\" A ballad is a narrative poem that tells a story. Ballads began as folk songs and are being used today in modern music. A typical ballad consists of stanzas that contain a quartering or four poetic lines. An example is \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" \\n\\nA pastoral poem talks about shepherds, livestock farmers, or peasants and rural life. In essence, it talks about communal settings. An example of this is Christopher Marlowe\\'s \"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love.\" A nonsense poem was popularized by Edward Lear. It is a poem of speech writing or any other communication that lacks coherent meaning. An example is \"Hey Diddle Diddle\" by an anonymous person. It sort of reminds one of the sounds babies make. \\n\\nOther kinds of poems or poetry include panegyric, limerick, and lyric. And that brings us to the end of the class. See you next time!',\n",
       " \"If you could write a genre of literature, which one would you choose? Drama, poetry, or prose? Personally, I'm not sure which one I would choose. By the end of this class, you'll be better equipped to make that decision. In today's class, we will be talking about prose. What is prose? It is a genre of literature that has no standard magical structure like poetry. It is just like the words coming out of my mouth. It has no standard rhythmic structure like poetry, nor is it written in a script-like form like drama. It is written using sentences that are combined to form paragraphs. Normal everyday speech is spoken in prose. In fact, most people think and write in prose form. There are two main types of prose: fiction and non-fiction. In summary, we can say that prose is a genre of literature that has no standard metrical structure. It is usually written using sentences that are combined to form paragraphs. Some of the characteristics of prose are that it is written in complete sentences, it is written in chapters and paragraphs, it is made up of characters (for example, a clown or a jolly elephant), and it has a plot, which is a storyline.

       " \"It's Monday morning at Bryan's school. Last week was hectic and boring for him. While on the school bus this morning, he imagined how much fun he would have in school this week. He pictured himself laughing so hard at lunch with his friends and listening to interesting stories from Mrs. Ray. Although it hasn't happened yet, it could be true that Bryan will have a great time at school this week. This is just an example of fiction. In one of our previous lessons, we learned that fiction is a form of any work that deals with imaginary and invented information or events created by the writer. There are different types of fiction, including mystery, fantasy, fable, allegory, parables, romance, folk tales, and creative writing.\\n\\nWhat is mystery? Mystery is a fictional story about something that is impossible or difficult to figure out. It can be a secret, riddle, or puzzle that requires intelligence to reveal the unknown. Mysteries are mostly focused on investigation activity where a detective has to solve a puzzle to find a solution to a crime or crack the case. An example is Sherlock Holmes by author Conan Doyle.\\n\\nHave you seen Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling? It is categorized under a type of fiction known as fantasy. Fantasy is a type of fiction that employs magic and other supernatural phenomena as the primary plot element, theme, or setting. It usually takes place in imaginary worlds where magic and magical creatures are common. It is not horror or science fiction because it avoids scientific and mockable themes, respectively. However, it is possible for there to be an overlap with these other kinds of stories. An example of fantasy is Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling.\\n\\nFable is a fictional story in prose that features animals, mythical creatures, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are anthropomorphized. Examples are given human qualities such as verbal communication and illustrate a moral lesson. It is usually rounded off with a pithy maxim.\\n\\nAllegory is more of a rhetorical device in which characters or events in a literary, visual, or musical art form represent or symbolize ideas and concepts. It conveys hidden messages through symbolic figures, actions, imagery, and/or events.\\n\\nParables are stories that teach a lesson. They are didactic in nature and are written in prose or verse. They illustrate one or more instructive lessons or principles. They differ from fables because they feature human characters rather than animals, flowers, and the like. It is a type of analogy.\\n\\nWe also have folktales. These are stories or legends handed down from generation to generation, usually by oral retelling. Folktales often explain something that happens in nature or convey a certain truth about life.\\n\\nCreative writing is any writing that goes outside the bounds of technical forms of literature. It is identified by an emphasis on narrative crafts, character development, and the use of various traditions of poetry and poetics. It can be technically considered to be any writing of original composition. In the actual sense, creative writing is a more contemporary and process-oriented name for what has been traditionally called literature, including the variety of its genres. That's all for today's class on the types of fiction. See you in the next one!\",\n",
       " '```Welcome to class! Today, we will be discussing the three major types of drama: comedy, tragedy, and tragicomedy. Comedy, as the name suggests, is a type of drama characterized by a humorous or satirical tone. Examples of comedy include parody, satire, comedy of manners, romantic comedy, farce, burlesque, and many others. One example of a comedy is Oliver Goldsmith\\'s \"She Stoops to Conquer.\" \\n\\nMoving on to tragedy, this type of drama has a somber mood and treats a serious subject about human suffering or a terrible event in the life of a hero whose tragic flaw leads to an unhappy ending. It also invokes an outburst of emotions from the audience. Examples of tragedy include William Shakespeare\\'s dramas like \"Hamlet,\" \"Othello,\" \"Macbeth,\" \"Julius Caesar,\" \"King Lear,\" and so on. \\n\\nFinally, tragicomedy is a mixture of both comedy and tragedy. As a tragic play, it contains enough comic elements to lighten the overall mood or a serious play with a happy ending. An example of this is William Shakespeare\\'s \"The Merchant of Venice.\" If you are observant, you would notice that William Shakespeare wrote quite a number of these different types of drama. \\n\\nAnyway, we have come to the end of this class.

       " \"Hello and welcome to class! Today, we will be discussing character and characterization in prose writing. A character can be any person, animal, or even an inanimate object in a narrative story. Characters may be presented through descriptions, actions, speech, or thoughts. There are different types of characters that serve unique functions in a story.\\n\\nFirst, we have the confidant. This is someone in whom the main character confides. The main character reveals their thoughts, intentions, and personality traits to this confidant, who may be a person, animal, or any other subject or object.\\n\\nNext, we have the dynamic character. This character is not static and changes during the course of a novel or story. This is why a dynamic character is also called a developing character.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a static character remains the same throughout the whole story. The events in a story or novel do not change the character's outlook, perceptions, habits, personality, or motivations.\\n\\nThe antagonist is a bad guy or opponent of the protagonist or main character. The action in the story arises from a conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist. The antagonist can be a person, an inanimate object, an animal, or nature itself.\\n\\nEvery story has a protagonist or a main character who creates the action of the plot and engages readers, arousing their empathy and interest. The protagonist is often a hero or heroine of the story as the whole plot is centered around him or her.\\n\\nWe also have the round character. This character is a well-developed and complex figure in a story. Such characters are more realistic and demonstrate more depth in their personalities. They make surprising or puzzling decisions, thereby attracting readers' attention.\\n\\nIn contrast, the flat character does not change during the story and usually only reveals one or two personality traits. Lastly, we have the stock character. This character is a flat character that is instantly recognizable by readers. Like a flat character, the stock character does not undergo any development throughout the story.\\n\\nNow that you know the different kinds of characters that we have, let's move on to characterization. See you in the next class!\",\n",
       " '\"Characterization is the process of creating characters for a narrative. It involves the \\'how\\' of creating the \\'what\\', which is the character. These literary elements can be used in dramatic works of art or everyday conversation. One important element of characterization is conflict, which initiates a struggle between the main character and other forces in the narrative. Through this struggle, readers get to see the kind of person the characters are, and the narrative of the story is driven. Without conflict, the story has no point or purpose. Another important literary element is plot, which is the storyline of a text. It consists of a series of events that the author puts together to create a story. The sequence of these events is known as the plot. A story cannot exist without a plot. A good plot is one that has well-developed characters engaging in several conflicts. There is a traditional plot structure that many texts follow, which includes exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement. Exposition is the point where the characters and setting of the story are revealed or introduced. Rising action is the point where conflict builds up in the story. Climax occurs when the conflict is at its peak and when there seems to be no visible solution to the conflicts. Falling action occurs after the climax, where the reader is still unsure if the protagonist will be able to resolve the conflicts. Finally, the denouement, also called the resolution, is the conclusion of the plot, where the conflict is typically resolved. With what you have learned today, you will be able to identify the different kinds of characters and what characterization entails the next time you pick up a storybook to read. Have a great day!\"',\n",
       " \"Welcome back to class! Today, we'll be discussing plots in prose writing. In our previous class on character and characterization, we defined plot as the storyline of a prose writing. Now, we will take things up a notch by considering the different types of plots. There are two main types: simple plots and complex plots. A simple plot is straightforward and moves towards resolution without too many obstacles for the protagonist to overcome. On the other hand, a complex plot has several storylines that intermingle and go back and forth in time. It does not move in a straight line towards resolution, so there are usually many obstacles to overcome, and the ending could be ambiguous. That brings us to the end of the class. See you in the next one!\",\n",
       " \"In today's class, we'll be examining other elements of characterization, namely theme and setting. Whenever you read a story, it has a theme and a setting. The theme is the sum total of the idea behind a story. It is deeper than subject matter; in fact, it is the vision of the novel and raises profound questions about life. On the other hand, setting is the environment or surrounding in which the story, whether non-fiction or fiction, took place. It is the when and where of the story. You need to know that setting is an essential component of literature and one of the first things a writer considers before writing their story. It influences the story's characters and events and enhances the reader's ability to imagine those characters and events. There are two types of settings: fictional and non-fictional settings, that is, real or imagined settings, respectively. A fictional story can be set in a rural location, such as Nigeria, Ghana, or Uganda. That's all we have for you today concerning theme and setting. See you next time!\",\n",

There are several types of narrative techniques, including first person narrator, where the writer or character uses their own voice to tell the story. This technique is popular in personal diaries, memoirs, and mystery novels. \\n\\nAnother technique is the third person omniscient narrator, where the author tells the story through an outside narrator who knows everything. This technique is often used to speak directly to readers. \\n\\nThere\\'s also the mixed narrative technique, where the author uses more than one technique in their work.

Although Barakah is uneducated, he is still smarter than Lacunae, whose education is incomplete. Everyone in the village talks about Lacunae because of the way he dresses in a small suit and tie. He dislikes the village clothes and their way of life because he sees it as local. This is the same reason why he doesn't want to pay the city's bright price. He believes that villages need to stop doing this. Lacunae has big dreams of transforming his village into beautiful cities like Lagos and Ibadan, where women are allowed to work and talk with their husbands, and not just pushed into the kitchen like slaves. Lacunae loves Sidi and tries to teach her to be a modern woman, but she hates it and tells him that she dislikes the strange, unhealthy mouth thing he performs.

He believes that he is very disciplined, but he relaxes just a little bit, allowing Barakah to steal Sidi away from him. He accepts to take Sidi back after Baraka rips up, which is his way of avoiding the payment of her bright prize. Lacunae hates Barakah's way of life and condemns everything about him.

Prisca spoke about her coleslaw, which was a careful blend of carrots, cabbages, and cucumbers. Furthermore, she shared the benefits of each component and the combination as a whole. Just like Prisca's coleslaw, did you know that physics, which is a branch of pure science, is a careful blend of the nature and properties of matter, energy, and natural phenomena of the universe? Now you know! And just like coleslaw being a vegetable is profitable for our health, physics helps us to understand how the world works around us, from earthquakes to light bulbs, cell phones to muscles, lungs, and brains.

In fact, we hardly find a device in which the laws of physics are not involved. For example, air conditioners and refrigerators are based on the physics concept of cooling by rapid evaporation, conducting properties of materials, and convention. Modern-day medical workers would not be effective if not for some applications of physics in designing X-rays, ultrasounds, microscopes, electrocardiograms, pacemakers, and radiotherapy equipment. The communication sectors, including radio, television, satellite, space exploration, and generation and distribution of light, are all productive principles of physics.

So, we can say that work involves the movement of an object with the application of external force in the direction of the force. The standard unit of work is newton meter or joules. Remember, the formula for calculating work done is force multiplied by displacement. I hope you found this interesting. See you in my next class!\",\n",
       " \"Terry is a 10-year-old boy who loves to play with toys. One day, his dad brought him a gigantic bunny toy, but Terry couldn't lift it up. The reason was that he didn't have enough energy to perform such a Herculean task. As a result, his dad had to return the toy and get a smaller one. This incident taught us that energy is the ability to perform work, and it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. The unit of energy is called joules, and there are different types of energy, such as kinetic energy (energy in motion), potential energy (energy at rest), mechanical energy, chemical energy, electric energy, magnetic energy, nuclear energy, and more.

       " \"Foreign: It was the end-of-year party at Focus High School, and the students engaged in various activities. One of the activities was a water-drinking competition. A 50-liter gallon of water was set before each contestant, and at the end of the game, they were scored according to the amount of water consumed over a particular time. Tonya emerged as the winner after consuming 10 liters in 20 minutes, followed by Jaco, who consumed seven liters in the same time. Just like the amount of water consumed per time, there is a concept in physics that measures the amount of energy consumed by a person or object per time. This concept can be calculated by dividing work done by time, and the formula for power is P = W/T, where P equals power, W equals work done, and T equals time taken. From today's class, we have learned that power is the rate of doing work. It is the amount of energy consumed per unit time, and its SI unit is in joules per second or watts. Power is also a physical concept that has several different meanings depending on the context and the information that is available. The unit watt is dedicated in honor of Sir James Watt, the developer of the steam engine. I hope you enjoyed the class, and I'll see you in the next one.\",\n",

We have learned that time is defined as the period in which a process, action, or an event takes place. Time is also called the point or period when something occurs. The most natural time unit is the solar day, which is manifested by the passing of day and night. It takes the earth one solar day to complete one revolution about its axis. One day equals 24 hours, one hour equals 60 minutes, and one minute equals 60 seconds. In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of time is the second, and the symbol is s.

The same concept applies to a door. For a door to move, you either push or pull it. By pushing or pulling the door and kicking the ball, you are applying a concept in physics called force. Did you know that? Now you know that motion cannot occur without force, and this force could be internal or external. So, we have learned that force is that which alters the state of rest or motion of your body in a straight line. It is either a push or a pull. Note that the force that moves your body can be external or internal.

The difference is that the boy is exerting a contact force, and the magnet is exerting a non-contact force. \\n\\nWow, that is interesting! So, we have learned that there are two types of forces: contact force and non-contact force. A contact force is a force that acts in direct physical contact with the body. For instance, when one pulls or pushes a box, the force is physical. On the other hand, non-contact force refers to situations where the force acts on the body without actually being in contact with it. The force acts at a distance or through a region around the body. This is called a non-contact force or force field. An example is the magnetic force. \\n\\nI'm sure you enjoyed the class. I'll see you in the next one!\",\n",

Georginio was set to take a penalty kick, but upon kicking the ball, it rolled on the ground and stopped just a few meters away from the goal post. How sad! Now, what do you think caused the ball to come to a halt? It's a concept in physics called friction. When two surfaces, like the ground and the ball, are in contact with each other, a particular force comes into play to resist the relative motion between them and seeks to stop it. This is the reason why when you rub your palms together, heat is generated because the force is trying to stop the relative motion between your palms. Wow, isn't that intriguing? We have learned that friction is a force that resists the motion between two bodies in contact. It is the force directed opposite to the direction of motion or attempted motion. The frictional force is always parallel to the surface in contact and is caused by molecular adhesion, surface roughness, deformations in surfaces in contact, etc. I'll see you next week.

Why is it more difficult to move a heavy couch than to push a football? Can you guess why a sticky note doesn't fall off a wall? The answer lies in the amount of friction present. A rough surface, heavy object at rest, and dry flow all have more friction than a smooth surface, light object, and wet or oily flow. This means that friction, which is the force opposing motion, is affected by several factors, including the nature of the surface, weight of an object, and surface area in contact. The larger the surface area of contact, the more friction is present.\",\n",

Have you ever wondered what keeps your phone from slipping out of your hand? Or what keeps your sticky notes on the wall? It\\'s friction! Friction is a force that opposes intended or relative motion between a stationary object and the surface on which it\\'s resting. Static friction exists between a stationary object and the surface on which it is resting, like my sticky note on the wall or my cell phone in my hand. Kinetic friction exists between two surfaces in relative motion, like my iron moving on my clothes or my legs walking on the ground in my room.

Examples include hats on our head, sticky notes on the wall, a bottle of water held in our hands, or a car parked on a hill.

The formula for static friction is force of static friction (fs) equals coefficient of static friction (mu s) times normal force (tau). For kinetic friction, the formula is force of kinetic friction (fk) equals coefficient of kinetic friction (mu k) times normal force.\\n\\nTo calculate the frictional force between two objects, simply multiply the coefficient of friction by the normal force. The coefficient of friction is represented by the Greek letter mu with a subscript k.\\n\\nLet's try some practice problems to solidify our understanding.\\n\\nQuestion 1: An object with a mass of 10 kilograms is placed on a smooth surface. Find the static friction if the coefficient of static friction is 0.3.\\n\\nSolution: We know that n equals mg, where n is the normal force, m is the mass, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 meters per second squared). Therefore, n equals 10 times 9.8, or 98 newtons. Using the formula fs equals mu s times tau, we can calculate that fs equals 0.3 times 98, or 29.4 newtons.\\n\\nQuestion 2: A boy is playing volleyball. Calculate the kinetic friction if the friction coefficient is 0.9 and the ball is thrown with a force of 250 newtons.\\n\\nSolution: Using the formula fk equals mu k times tau, we can calculate that fk equals 0.9 times 250, or 225 newtons.\\n\\nThat's it for today's lesson.

How would our cars come to a halt? How would we walk and not slip? How would we press our clothes? How would we hold our cup of drinking water? The list goes on and on. However, this indispensable friction has its disadvantages. It causes wear and tear. It is the reason the sole of your shoes and the tire in the vehicles wear out. Really? Yes, it is. Today, we have learned that the concept called friction is important. Friction between pen and paper enables us to write on the paper. It enables us to hold the pen. Friction between our feet and the ground allows our movements like standing, walking, and running. It holds the screw in wood. Friction between surfaces of the road and the tires of our vehicles allows the vehicles to move without slipping. However, if it has its side effects, friction produces heat, but some of the energy is wasted in overcoming friction. Now, it causes wear and tear of soles of our shoes. For example, the sole of our shoes wears out after prolonged use because of friction with the rough surface. Now, the heat produced by friction damages rubber parts of the machine. Friction causes moving objects to stop or slow down. Those are the disadvantages of friction, but I'm sure you love the advantages too. I'll see you in the next class.\",\n",

Kiki, Joy, and Faithful are all at different points in reference to one another, with their point of origin being the tree, whiteboard, and television set respectively. In physics, the location of a point is represented using rectangular coordinates on the x and y axis, such as a point 2 units from the origin on the x-axis and 3 units from the origin on the y-axis, which would be represented as coordinates (2,3). Therefore, we have learned that position is a place where someone or something is located from its origin at a particular time, and it is a point in space determined by its distance and direction from other points. In physics, position is represented using rectangular coordinates on the x and y axis, with x being written first followed by y. Distance is commonly measured using a tape measure, a vernier caliper, or a micrometer screw gauge.

Velocity is measured by the distance from one point to another in a specified direction with respect to time. If an object travels one kilometer north every hour, then its velocity is uniform. However, if an object travels one kilometer in one hour and two kilometers in one hour and 30 minutes, then its velocity is non-uniform.

Well, whenever a body falls freely, its velocity increases steadily from zero. Conversely, when a body is thrown upwards, its speed decreases gradually until it comes to a stop. This is due to the fact that the Earth attracts bodies close to it or on its surface. It's interesting to note that the acceleration due to the gravitational pull of the Earth is estimated to be an average of 9.82 meters per second squared.

Similarly, to obtain different parameters of motion such as acceleration, distance, and velocity, there are three different equations that can be used. Their derivations are shown below. The first equation defines acceleration (a) as a = (v - u) / t, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, and t is the time taken to change from u to v. We can rearrange this equation to become v = u + at. The second equation is for a body whose speed changes from u to v. The average speed is given by (u + v) / 2, and the distance covered (s) is given by s = ut + (1/2)at^2. If we square both sides of equation one and expand, we have v^2 = u^2 + 2ua(t) + a^2(t^2).

Do you know why that is? It's because of a concept in physics called buoyancy. When an object is immersed in a fluid, a force is applied to it that pushes it upwards. That upward force is known as the buoyant force. Buoyancy depends on the volume of the body submerged in the fluid and the density of the fluid in which the body is immersed. So, we have learned that the ability of a liquid to make an object float partially or completely on the surface of the water is a phenomenon known as buoyancy. An example of this is when a mast in a fleet comes up to the surface. The difference between the upward and downward forces acting on the bottom and top of the cube, respectively, is called buoyancy.

The plastic spoon will float at the top of the liquid while the stone will sink to the bottom of the bowl.

On the other hand, the stone sinks because its weight is greater than the buoyant force, resulting in negative buoyancy. When the weight of an object is equal to the fluid it displaces, it is called neutral buoyancy. Today, we learned that positive buoyancy occurs when an object is lighter than the fluid it displaces, causing it to float. For example, a swimmer experiences a great amount of buoyant force. Negative buoyancy occurs when an object is denser than the fluid it displaces, causing it to sink. For example, a submarine is designed to operate underwater by storing and releasing water through ballast tanks. Neutral buoyancy occurs when an object's weight is equal to the fluid it displaces. For example, a scuba diver is trained in techniques to regulate buoyancy underwater. I hope you enjoyed this lesson and I'll see you in the next one.```\",\n",

So, we have learned that the ease of a floating balloon is determined by buoyancy. Hydrogen, helium, and hot air are the ideal gases for balloon aviation. A balloon filled with lighter gas, such as hydrogen, will keep rising up when released from the end, and a hot air balloon will keep rising as well with the people in the carriage.

This principle applies to both floating and submerged bodies and to all fluids. It helps determine whether a given body will float or sink in a given fluid. If the body is less dense than the fluid, it will float, or in the case of a balloon, it will rise. If the body is denser than the fluid, it will sink, or in the case of a balloon, it will drop.

When we equate the dimensional formula to the physical quantity, it is called a dimensional equation. \\n\\nFor example, the dimensional formula for force is MLT^-2 (mass x length x time^-2). Velocity equals distance divided by time, which is LT^-1 (length x time^-1). Acceleration equals velocity divided by time, which is LT^-2. Force equals mass times acceleration, which is MLT^-2. The dimensions of force are one in mass, one in length, and raised to the power of -2 in time. The equation is written as force = MLT^-2. \\n\\nTherefore, we have learned that the dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers to which the fundamental units of mass, length, and time must be raised to represent the physical quantity. The dimensional formula is a unit of physical quantity expressed in terms of mass, length, and time. The dimensional equation is obtained when we equate the dimensional formula with the physical quantity. See you in the next class!',\n",

On weighing the liquid that poured out from the container, she found that it had the same mass as the wood.

Today, we have learned that the weight of the displaced fluid is equal to the apparent loss of weight. This apparent loss is the buoyancy force on an object, which is called upthrust. \\n\\nReal weight equals apparent weight plus apparent loss. Since the apparent loss is equal to upthrust, the weight will now be equal to the apparent weight plus upthrust. Upthrust will now be equal to the real weight minus the apparent weight.

But did you know that there is also a formula for upthrust in physics? Yes, there is! Would you like to know it? Let\\'s go. The formula for upthrust is real weight minus apparent weight. Let\\'s take some examples. If a body weighs 5.5 newtons in air and 3 newtons when completely immersed in kerosene, what is the upthrust experienced by the body? The weight of the body in the air is 5.5 newtons, and the apparent weight of the body when immersed in kerosene is 3 newtons. Therefore, upthrust equals real weight minus apparent weight, which is 5.5 newtons minus 3 newtons, which equals 2.5 newtons. That\\'s simple, right? Let\\'s take another example. If a body weighs 3 newtons when totally immersed in water contained in an overflow can, and the weight of displaced water is 2.6 newtons, what is the real weight of the object? The apparent weight is 3 newtons, and according to Archimedes\\' principle, upthrust equals real weight minus apparent weight. Therefore, 2.6 newtons will be equal to real weight minus 3 newtons. When we rearrange the formula, we get real weight equals 2.6 newtons plus 3 newtons, which gives us 5.6 newtons. So we have learned that there is a formula for calculating upthrust, and the formula is upthrust equals real weight minus apparent weight. When I mention newtons, I also mean kilograms.

Flotation is the ability of an object or person to stay at the upper level of a fluid. Today, we learned that flotation can be defined as the tendency of an object to rise up to the upper levels of the fluid or to stay on the surface of the fluid.

We were amazed by this discovery. \\n\\nWe also learned that when an object floats in water, it displaces an amount of water equal to its weight. This is known as the law of floatation. Therefore, if a log weighing 200 kilograms is floating in water and displacing 200 kilograms of water, it will displace the same amount of any fluid in which it floats. \\n\\nIn conclusion, we have learned that the law of floatation states that a floating body displaces its own weight of the fluid in which it floats. This means that if a log weighing 200 kilograms (or 2000 newton) floats in water and displaces 200 kilograms (or 2000 newton) of water, it will displace the same amount of fluid in which it floats.

Energy is transferred from one body to another as a result of the difference in temperature. So, we have learned today that heat energy is transferred between two points because of the temperature difference. If there is no temperature difference, there will be no transfer of energy, that is heat. Heat energy is measured in joules and is named after James Prescott Joule, who lived from 1819 to 1889.

Similarly, when heat is applied to a body, its temperature rises. The extent of the rise in temperature depends on the amount of heat supplied, the mass of the body, and the nature of the body. For instance, if the same amount of heat is supplied to water in a kettle and water in a bucket for the same time interval, the water in the kettle appears hotter and the water in the bucket appears colder.

Take a block of ice and apply heat, you will notice that it melts and expands. On the other hand, if you put water in the freezer, it will contract and solidify. This ability of water to contract when cooled and expand when heated is known as thermal expansion. \\n\\nIt\\'s fascinating to know that most materials are subject to thermal expansion, which is a tendency to expand when heated and contract when cooled. We can observe examples of this concept in our daily lives, such as cracks in the road when it expands on heating, electrical power lines that sag due to thermal expansion, and metal-framed windows that require rubber spacers to avoid thermal expansion. \\n\\nMoreover, the length of a metal bar gets longer on heating, which is another example of thermal expansion.

Whenever you change the temperature of a substance, it can result in a change of state from solid to liquid or liquid to gas. Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas. For example, water exists as ice (solid) at a temperature below zero degrees Celsius. At zero degrees Celsius, the ice begins to melt into water (liquid) while the temperature remains constant.

       " '\"Welcome back to class! Today, I\\'m going to be teaching you about the application of conduction in everyday life. Have you ever seen a wooden cooking pot? It\\'s so rare, if not impossible. Do you know why? Come closer, let me tell you a secret. One major reason wood is not utilized in the production of cooking pots is because it\\'s a very poor conductor of heat. That\\'s enlightening, I\\'m sure. That means your food will not get cooked as heat is required to cook your food. This is just one application of conduction. Let\\'s talk about some more applications. Cooking pots are made of metals such as aluminum because metals are good conductors of heat. This allows heat to flow and be conducted easily and quickly into the food being cooked in the pot. Handles of cooking pots and pans are made of poor conductors of heat such as plastic and wood. Thus, the handles are not hot when the pot becomes hot during cooking and can be handled without burning one\\'s fingers. On sunny days, houses and roofs that are insulated with asbestos sheets are generally cooler inside than those roofed with aluminum sheets. This is because asbestos insulates the Earth better than aluminum. Wow, all these are so profound! Today, we have learned that conduction can be applied in our daily living in the production of cooking utensils like pots, in determining the materials for roofing our houses, and also during cold weather. Sweaters or clothes made of thick woolen materials are going to insulate the body and prevent heat loss from the body. The body is therefore kept warm. I\\'m sure you understood the class. I\\'ll see you in the next one.\"',\n",
       " \"Mr. Junior arrived at the office late and was issued a query for not being punctual. An important point he stated while responding was that the radiator of his car was bad and it was overheating. He had to take the public bus to work. The work of the radiator is to keep the car engine cool by transferring the heat from the fluid inside to the air outside, therefore cooling the fluid while which in turn cools the engine. This process of circulation of hot water and cold is an application of convection. It's amazing how convection is applied in our daily living, in our car engines, and construction of windows for our houses. Good architecture ensures that the windows are well arranged to allow circulation of air. This is called natural convection. Warm air rises and escapes, allowing cool air to flow into the house. Fans are used to induce circulation of air to ventilate rooms. This is also called forced convection. The land and sea breeze which occur in coastal areas are induced by differences that are caught between the heating or cooling of the water surfaces and the adjacent land surface.

Get a glass rod and rub it repeatedly with a silk cloth. After a while, you will notice that they begin to attract each other. This happens because when the glass rod is rubbed with the silk cloth, the glass quickly loses electrons, and the silk takes electrons out of the glass rod. As a result, after rubbing, the glass rod becomes positively charged, and the silk gets negatively charged. We have learned that whenever two bodies, like an ebonite rod and a fur, are rubbed together, they become electrified and attract each other. Other examples of such bodies are silk and glass. There are two types of charges: positive and negative charges. They attract each other because the law of electrostatics states that like charges repel each other, and unlike charges attract each other. I'm sure you understood and enjoyed the class.

Electrostatic induction is a method of charging a body by introducing a charged body to a neutral body. To charge a body positively, a negative charge is brought near, and to charge a body negatively, a positively charged rod is brought near. \\n\\nSo, what happens when you charge by electrostatic induction? When a charged body is introduced to a neutral body, the neutral body becomes induced with the charge. To charge a body, the neutral body is made to stand on an insulator, not in a conductor. Then, a charged body is introduced to the neutral body by electrostatic induction. The nearer side of the neutral body gets reversely charged, while the further sides get similarly charged. \\n\\nIn conclusion, to charge your body positively, a negatively charged rod is brought near, and to charge your body negatively, a positively charged rod is brought near.

Do you know why? I'll tell you. This is because there is a frictional force trying to oppose the movement of your hands. This phenomenon also occurs when substances such as glass and silk are rubbed together. The friction between them causes electrons to gain energy. Electrons gain enough energy to lift the glass and rub off onto the silk. Now, we have learned that we can charge a substance by friction. For example, if two substances such as glass and silk are rubbed together, they become electrically charged. During rubbing, some electrons are transferred from the glass to the silk. The silk acquires a net negative charge (excess electrons), while the glass acquires a net positive charge (electron deficit). Also, if ebonite (hard rubber) is rubbed with fur, the ebonite is negatively charged, and the fur is positively charged. A body with a positive charge attracts one with a negative charge but repels one with a positive charge. That is, like charges repel, and unlike charges attract. I'm sure you understood the class.

A lightning conductor consists of a copper strip with a sharply pointed end or spikes projecting above the building to be protected. The lower end is connected to a metal plate buried in the ground.

Other common properties include a motherboard, processor, disk, memory, graphics card, keyboard, mouse, and display device. Wow, that\\'s enlightening! Just like laptops, electric fields also have their own properties. Would you like to know more? Let\\'s explore. Field lines never intersect each other and are perpendicular to the surface charge. The field is strong when the lines are close together and weak when they move apart. The number of field lines is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge. We have learned that the electric field has its own properties. Other properties of the electric field include: electric field lines start from the positive charge and end at the negative charge. If the charge is single, then the lines start or end at infinity. The line curves are continuous in a charge-free region. When the electric and magnetic fields combine, they form the electromagnetic field. I\\'m sure you understood the class. I\\'ll see you in the next one.\"',\n",

Now, I'm sure you want to know: V = IR, where V is the voltage in volts, R is the resistance in ohms, and I is the current in amperes. Let's take some examples, shall we? \\n\\nFirst, let's find the voltage between two points if the resistance of an electric ion is 50 ohms and 3.2 amperes of current flows through the resistance. The solution is straightforward: given parameters resistance (R) equals 50 ohms, current (I) equals 3.2 amps, therefore voltage (V) equals I x R, which gives us 160 volts. \\n\\nNow, let's have one more example. Calculate the current flowing through an 8 ohm device when it is connected to a 12 volt supply. The solution is: V = IR, therefore, changing the subject of the formula, we would have I = V / R. Now, substituting the values, we get I = 12 / 8, which gives us 1.5 amps. \\n\\nToday, we have learned that Ohm's Law has the formula V = IR, where V is the voltage in volts, R is the resistance in ohms, and I is the current in amperes.

Those who were well-behaved were humbled by it, while the obstinate ones saw it as fun times and mocked her while serving their punishment. Just as the punishment had varying effects on the students, temperature has separate effects on the resistance of various substances depending on their nature.

One particular instrument stood out to him. It looked like a video camera, similar to the ones used in shooting movies. The handler was looking into it, squinting like a photographer or videographer would. Aminu was so intrigued by what they could be looking at that he ran to meet them. He asked, \"Excuse me, is that a camera?\" The man laughed and replied, \"No, it\\'s a theoretical light. A theodolite is another important surveying tool. It contains a tripod stand made of wood or lightweight metal with solid or telescope legs. This tripod stand forms the base of the instrument. It has a lower plate that contains a graduated horizontal circle made of glass or brass. The theodolite also has a spirit level that is used to define the horizontal plane against which angles of elevation and depression are measured. Theodolites are used to measure horizontal or vertical angles or planes. We hope you enjoyed this lesson and look forward to seeing you in the next one.\"',\n",

Nevertheless, I was determined not to give up. So, every time I measured and my measuring tape had reached its maximum length, I would mark the point. Then, I would start my measurement again from the marked point. Eventually, I succeeded, and when I went to show my father my calculation, it turned out to be correct.\\n\\nIn our previous lesson, we discussed Gunter's chain, which is used in detailed measurement. Whenever the chain ends, an arrow or pin is used to mark the endpoint, just like how I was marking the end of my measuring tape every time it had reached its final length. The arrow or pin is a very useful surveying tool, mostly used in chain measurements alongside the contest chain. It is a thin pointed steel wire about 30 cm long, with one end carved into a ring. A red cloth is normally attached to it so that it can be seen from afar.\\n\\nIf you recall our lecture on Godzilla's chain, then you are aware of chaining as a means of measurement.

My father owned a large farm and one day he invited some surveyors to expand the farm and get loans from the bank. While the surveyors were on the farm, I was in the kitchen being scolded by my mother for breaking a mop stick while trying to kill a cockroach. My mother threatened to flog me if I didn't provide another stick. I went to the kitchen crying and hoping to find a stick lying around. I saw a long staff painted black and white, which I thought would look good in the house. However, it belonged to the surveyors. I'll tell you later if I managed to get it or if I got caught. Anyways, the black and white staff is used to take short measurements and is often used with a Gunter's chain.

There are also permanent number signs painted on the ground with marks. Sometimes, in the case of the end of a 100 meter or 400 meter race, these track lines and numbers are apparent on the ground. They don't have to be repainted for every new race. In surveying, permanent marks are also made. They aren't quite the same as those seen on the track feet, but it's the same goal. They signify a particular position or point. Pickers or peelers are used instead of painting signs or lines on the ground because they are permanent. Survey marks of any kind are commonly made of concrete, iron, or steel. Pillars are usually rectangular blocks with marks inscribed on top of the block. The beakers are always burned in the ground. Beacons help in demarcating boundaries. If used, it is used for marking the points being measured. This is essential in recognizing the measured or surveyed area. The beacon is the last form of surveying tool we will be discussing, and this means we have come to the end of our lesson on farm surveying tools.

Well, my friend Yummy carries several papers around with him. These papers contain drawings and plans of several buildings which are about to be constructed. One day, I asked Yummy, \"Why do you need to draw the building or put any of the building plan to paper? Why not just start?\" Yummy laughed and said, \"Failure to prepare is definitely preparation to fail.\" \\n\\nJoining the building plan helps to give direction to everyone involved in the construction process. Because of the building plan, they have an idea of what to do and can execute accordingly. That made a lot of sense to me. Does it make sense to you? \\n\\nThe same thing is done in farms and it is called farm planning. Farm planning is simply the drawing or outline of a farmstead in order to put the land to use for which it is best suited. In case you are confused about the farmstead, a farmstead can be defined as a farmhouse including all its production and processing structures. This means that the farmstead is both a home and a production center. \\n\\nWhy is farm planning important? Just like my friend Yummy mentioned, it enables a farmer to make proper use of the land by ensuring proper sighting of certain beauties and structures in certain locations within the farmstead. Farm planning also ensures that the livestock building is located properly in relation to other farm buildings. Farm planning promotes neatness and prevents pollution within the farmstead. \\n\\nWe hope you enjoyed this lesson. See you in the next one!',\n",

He is prepared to construct the necessary structures on the farm, but he is unsure about the placement of each structure and how to ensure that his farm is properly arranged. In our last lesson, we discussed farm planning, which is the process of creating a drawing or outline of a farmstead to make the best use of the land. Therefore, Bello needs to carry out farm planning to ensure that his farmstead is properly cited. To properly cite the structures and plan the farm outline, some factors must be considered. Today's lesson will focus on some of the factors that influence the sighting of farms or farmsteads, such as topography, soil type, accessibility, water supply, hygiene, market, and drainage. Depending on the particular structure, these factors must be taken into consideration. For instance, when building a residential facility on the farm, key factors like water supply, topography, hygiene, and netness to your animals shelter and other structures must be considered. This is because you don't want animals walking into your home or transmitting diseases. You might also want to build a residential facility away from a machine room to protect your house from noise.

However, no one expected that Bello would allow his sentiments to affect the design and construction of his farm. Bello simply refused to take any advice regarding the planning of his farm. He insisted that he knew what to do, even though he had no experience with farm planning and had never even lived on the farm before. So, everybody left Bello to his farm planning, praying that everything would work out in the end. Can you guess how things turned out?\\n\\nBello decided to build his livestock building on the best soil in the farm. He did not engage any principle of farmstead layout because he didn't even know such principles existed. After erecting buildings on some of the good soil, Bello realized that the soil where he planted crops was terrible, and he would have to spend some money making it viable. He also built his residential and office building right near the animal shelter. Every day, it would be greeted with noise from animals, in addition to their droppings and unpleasant smells. Needless to say, Bello eventually regretted his actions. This whole thing could have been avoided if Bello had just employed the principles of farmstead layout.\\n\\nWhat are these principles? Let's look at a few of them. The first is that crops should be planted on the best soil on the farm, while livestock buildings can be erected on the porous soil in the farm. If you recall correctly, Bello did the opposite because he wouldn't listen. Buildings should also be located in easily accessible areas. You wouldn't want people getting lost or getting tired on their way to the residential or administrative buildings.

       " \"Today, we are going to learn how to construct a vegetable garden that can house thousands of plants. This requires us to do a little bit of math, but it's the simplest type of math, so don't be afraid to try it. First, we need to calculate the area of the farmland. If we don't know the shape of the plot of land, we can use different formulas to calculate the area. For example, the area of a triangular plot of land can be calculated with the formula 1/2 bh, where b stands for the base and h represents the height. On the other hand, the area of a rectangular plot of land can be calculated by simply multiplying the length and breadth of the farmland. \\n\\nAfter calculating the area, we need to have an idea of how many plants we can plant in this garden. To do this, we need to know the spacing between each plant and the next. Let's assume there's a space of 30 centimeters by 30 centimeters between each plant. With an idea of the spacing between each plant, we can finally calculate the total plant population. The total plant population is simply the area of the farmland in square meters divided by the spacing between the crops in square meters. \\n\\nNow, let's try an example. If the length and width of a farm are 60 and 30 meters, and the spacing between each plant is 30 centimeters, we can calculate the area of the farmland, total plant population, and total population. The area of the farmland is 60 meters times 30 meters, making the area 1,800 square meters. The spacing is calculated as 30 centimeters times 30 centimeters, which is 0.09 square meters. Now we can calculate the total plant population, which is the area divided by the spacing. This will give us 20,000 crops. If there are two crops per stand, that means in total we have 20,000 times two, which equals 40,000 crops. \\n\\nIf you got it right, give yourself a round of applause. Even if you didn't, still give yourself a round of applause. You can try it again. We hope you enjoyed this lesson. See you in the next one!\",\n",
       " \"If I asked you to name the essential factors for crop growth, you would likely mention sunlight, water, soil type, and soil fertility. And you would be correct. However, there is a more structured and refined way to answer this question. For instance, if I asked you about the factors affecting salt production, you could categorize them into three classes of environmental factors: climatic, biotic, and edifice. Let's take a brief look at each of these factors.\\n\\nClimatic factors refer to the average weather conditions of a place over a period of time. These factors include rainfall, sunlight, relative humidity, wind, temperature, and drought. They are crucial in crop production, and seasons of drought can stunt crop growth if proper measures are not put in place.\\n\\nBiotic factors, on the other hand, are more concerned with soil organisms. They refer to the living organisms and activities that contribute to the fertility and viability of the soil. Examples include soil organisms such as bacteria, fungi, earthworms, rodents, and termites. Pests and parasites are other biotic factors that must be considered.\\n\\nEdifice factors refer to factors related to the soil, such as soil type, soil structures, soil pH, soil fertility, and topography. As we move further in the lessons, you'll see why each of these factors is important. See you then!\",\n",
       " \"In Northern Nigeria, they experience a lot of drought and dry seasons. This means that there are seasons where there is no rainfall, which is known as drought. Rainfall is crucial for the growth of crops, and the absence of it adversely affects crop production. This explains why only certain types of crops are grown in Northern Nigeria. Rainfall also has adverse effects on crop production, which we will discuss shortly. In today's lesson, we will look at climatic factors that affect crop production, particularly rainfall and drought. Rainfall is defined as the release of excess condensed water vapor in the atmosphere into the earth. It determines the distribution of crops and animals, as well as the type of vegetation in an area. Some crops are grown in Northern Nigeria because they do better with minimal rainfall. Rainfall is necessary for seed germination and helps to dissolve nutrients, making them available for plants. However, excessive rainfall could lead to leaching of the soil, wasting soil nutrients. Drought, on the other hand, leads to poor crop establishment, delays in flowering, and flower abortion. It reduces physiological processes due to protoplasm dehydration and causes wilting. It also leads to a reduction in photosynthesis and plant failure. We hope you enjoyed this lesson and look forward to seeing you in the next one.\",\n",
       " \"When I was younger, I had a dream of becoming a farmer. I loved the idea of planting seeds and watching them grow. One day, after school, I took a bowl filled with some soil from my mom's garden and planted some beans. I didn't plant them outside because I wanted to surprise everybody, so I put the bowl under my bed where I was sure nobody would see it. The plan was to bring it out when it had reached a certain level of growth. However, my plan didn't work out as expected. There were many reasons why my seeds did not grow, but today we will focus on an important one - the lack of sunlight. My plants could not get adequate sunlight under the bed, and the temperature was not ideal for growth.\\n\\nIn today's lesson, we will be looking at the importance of sunlight and temperature in crop production. Sunlight is necessary for photosynthesis, which affects the productivity of crops, assists in drying, and is a key ingredient in photosynthesis. It also affects animals, such as their rising and roosting habits, and facilitates the rate of production in poultry. However, too much sunlight can cause stress in animals.\\n\\nTemperature, which is the degree of hotness or coldness in a place, is necessary for the germination of seeds. It affects the distribution of crops and animals, and both extremes of temperature do not favor plant and animal growth. An unfavorable temperature may result in seed dormancy. Temperature also affects the wilting, ripening, and maturity of crops, as well as microbial activities in relation to mineralization, which can lead to loss of minerals by vitalization. High temperature could lead to abortion in farm animals and can cause heat stress and egg drop in poultry.\\n\\nWe hope you enjoyed this lesson and look forward to seeing you in the next one.\",\n",
       " \"Have you ever thought about the impact of wind on crop production? It's easy to assume that wind has no effect, but that's not true. Wind is not only useful for drying clothes, but it also plays a crucial role in crop reduction. Depending on the intensity of the wind, it could either make or break all your efforts. \\n\\nFirstly, we can define wind as air in motion. It's important because it aids in seed and fruit dispersal, and even pollination. Wind is also essential in the distribution of rainfall and changes in seasons. However, high wind velocity could cause damage to crops and affect evapotranspiration. \\n\\nNow, let's talk about relative humidity. Relative humidity is defined as the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. This moisture eventually leads to the formation of rain. It affects the performance of plants and animals and determines the types of crops grown in an area. Low humidity causes heat stress in animals and affects their feed and water intake. It could also cause aridity and dryness. On the other hand, high humidity favors the growth of pathogens. \\n\\nWe hope you enjoyed this lesson. See you in the next one!\",\n",
       " \"Whenever people are asked to describe important factors that contribute to the growth of crops, they tend to forget about biotic factors. It's easy to remember things like sunlight, water, and soil, but what about the activities of living things that could affect crops either negatively or positively? Let's take pests for example. Pests only have negative effects to contribute. Some of them are vectors and spread diseases, while others destroy plants completely. However, there are certain soil organisms that aid in the fertility of the soil. They are needed to aid in the absorption of nutrients by the plant. These living factors can all be referred to as biotic factors. Biotic factors include soil organisms, pests, and parasites, and we'll be looking at the relevance of each of them. Soil organisms include organisms like bacteria, fungi, earthworms, and termites. Some of these organisms cause diseases, while others add aeration to the soil, percolation, and fertility. They aid in fertility by decomposing plant materials to form humus. Pests and other biotic factors include insects, rodents, birds, and some mammals. They reduce the yield of crops and animals, reduce their quality, and reduce the income of farmers. They also significantly increase the cost of production. Another biotic factor to consider is parasites. Parasites include ticks, liver flukes, tapeworms, roundworms, and mites. Just like pests, they reduce the yield and quality of production. They could also lead to the death of the plants and animals. They reduce the farmer's income, and the cost of control also increases the cost of production. See you in the next lesson!\",\n",
       " '\"When I was little, I didn\\'t know that the type of soil I used to plant mattered. This is why one day, I went to a construction site, packed some sand, and then proceeded to plant. Little me kept adding water and praying for a miracle, but of course, nothing grew. I just packed sand. Funny, right? Well, it\\'s also funny when you don\\'t know that there are factors that contribute to agricultural production. Efficient factors are related to the soil, and they include soil type, soil pH, soil texture, soil structure, soil fertility, and topography. Today, we\\'ll be looking at each of these factors. Soil pH is the degree of acidity or alkalinity in the soil. It affects the availability of soil nutrients to the plant and also affects the growth of plants. It also affects the presence of microorganisms and causes toxicity to plants and animals in the soil. The soil texture determines the type of soil in an area. It could also determine the level of soil fertility and the type of crops to be grown. It also determines the leaching and erosion of the soil. Soil structure is another factor to be considered. It is concerned with the fertility of the soil and determines the water holding capacity of the soil. It can also determine the amount of soil organism in addition to the level of soil aeration and percolation. The topography of the soil is the shape of the land in relation to the underlying rocks of the earth\\'s surface. A steep, gentle slope encourages soil erosion. It may also encourage the weathering of rocks, and even a flat slope can lead to the accumulation of soil and a better site for intensive farming. Soil fertility is an adaptive factor that determines the outcome of your farming effort. Fertile soils aid the production of both cash and fruit crops. They minimize the use of fertilizer and lead to a multiplication of beneficial soil organisms, thereby reducing the cost of production. Don\\'t be like little me. Ensure you remember how important the soil type is. There are three basic types of soil, which are loamy, sandy, and clay soils. Loamy soil is the best for agriculture. Sandy soil does not contain enough nutrients and, in addition, encourages leaching. Clay soil, on the other hand, encourages waterlogging. We hope you enjoyed this lesson.

Here\\'s my attempt:\\n\\nBicycle wheels and tires are circular in shape, and the word \"cycle\" is derived from the word \"circle.\" Today, we\\'re talking about cycles because they play an important role in life. Specifically, we\\'re referring to a repeated sequence of events that have no beginning or end. These cycles are used to describe continuous series of events that do not end, such as the nitrogen cycle.\\n\\nThe nitrogen cycle is a series of events through which nitrogen is made available to plants from the atmosphere. Nitrogen gas in the atmosphere is useless to plants, so it needs to undergo a series of reactions to be fixed into the soil and made usable by plants. The nitrogen cycle describes the process by which nitrogen is returned to the atmosphere, which is nature\\'s way of regulating the amount of nitrogen in both the soil and the air.\\n\\nIn the nitrogen cycle, we\\'ll be looking at the ways nitrogen is added to the soil, lost from the soil to the atmosphere, and converted to nitrates. Nitrogen can be added to the soil through direct fixation during rainfall, incorporation into the soil by free-living bacteria, or application of nitrogen fertilizers. Organic matter can also be converted to nitrates through processes like petrification and modification identification.\\n\\nIn our next lesson, we\\'ll look at the ways by which the soil loses nitrogen to the atmosphere.',\n",
       " \"As children, we were taught that we breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. We were told that this contributes to the balance in nature, and it's not wrong at all. However, did you know that plants also contribute to the balance of carbon dioxide in nature? They do this through the carbon cycle. In our last lesson, we rounded up on the nitrogen cycle, but we established that cycles are ways by which nature establishes balance and regulates the quantity of particular gases in both soil and air. In today's lesson, we'll be looking at the carbon cycle and discussing ways by which carbon dioxide is moved from the air and gained by the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is moved from the air mainly through photosynthesis. Do you remember what photosynthesis is? Carbon is, however, lost in the form of carbonate of calcium and magnesium through leaching and drainage. The atmosphere gains carbon dioxide through the burning of coal and wood. Volcanoes also release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is equally released through the respiration of both plants and animals. Death and decay of plants and animals lead to the release of carbon dioxide through the process of petrification. Seasonal bodies of water also allow the escape of carbon dioxide through the process of diffusion. Why is the carbon cycle so important? Well, plants use carbon dioxide obtained from the air to manufacture their food through photosynthesis. Carbon is an essential building block of all organic matter, and organic matter contains soil nutrients. So you can see why the carbon cycle is so essential.

The water cycle can easily describe the movement of water from the atmosphere to the earth and back to the atmosphere. So, do you want to know how the atmosphere receives water? That\\'s easy. The atmosphere receives water through evaporation from oceans and land, transpiration from plants, and breathing and respiration by plants and animals. All this water is eventually released as rainfall through condensation. Land also receives water through infiltration and percolation. Water exists in the soil in different forms such as hygroscopic form, capillary water, and gravitational water. You might ask why we are learning about the water cycle. Well, water is very essential to crops, and it\\'s important that we know the way in which it leaves the soil so we can know how to conserve it better. Water can be conserved in the soil through storage or reduction of water runoff, addition of humus or organic matter, mulching, cover cropping, contour reading, appropriate tillage, strip cropping, and removal of weeds to reduce transpiration and water loss. Let\\'s also discuss the importance of water to crops. Why should we bother to conserve water in the soil? Water provides the medium of absorption of nutrients. It is an essential raw material during photosynthesis, and it facilitates enzymic activities occurring in crop plants. Blue basin water also has a cooling effect on crops and helps in seed germination. Humans are not the only ones who need water to sustain life. Plants also need water to sustain life.

Unfortunately, there is no water supply in my garden, so I usually have to fetch water from the house and use it to water my beautiful flowers. The process of watering my flowers can be said to be a form of irrigation, and I'll tell you why. Irrigation can be defined as the artificial application of water to soil or land for farming purposes. This could be done in several ways, and there are three major types of irrigation systems: surface irrigation, subsurface irrigation, and overhead irrigation. You should keep in mind that several factors determine the irrigation system to be used. Some of these factors are the availability of water, slope of the land, soil type, type of crop, and size of the farmland. Since I have no water supply in my garden, I have to fetch and apply water directly. Also, my garden is small in size. Imagine if I had a much bigger garden, I would get tired attempting to water all the flowers. In this case, I might need a more effective method. Hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

What do you think would happen if you fail to water your plants? I used to have a garden, but one day I had to travel for about three months without leaving anyone in charge of my garden. When I came back, you can imagine the horror and pain I felt. My flowers were dead, the soil was dry, and everywhere was overgrown with weeds. There had been no one to water my flowers and take care of them. This is why irrigation is so important. Can you go three months without water? I'm sure you can't, and neither can plants. \\n\\nIn today's lesson, we'll be looking at the importance of irrigation in crop production. Irrigation softens the soil for tillage preparations. It also provides moisture, thereby preventing the soil and roots from drying up. Irrigation also helps in reducing the amount of salt accumulated in the topsoil, which can be injurious to the crops. Just like the human body, water cools the soil and reduces its temperature. As expected, irrigation increases crop productivity and yield and enables the crops to do well. This means that there will be crop production throughout the year, even when there is no rain. Irrigation also aids in microbial decomposition and nutrient release to the soil. \\n\\nHowever, irrigation could have a few negative effects. It could provide a humid environment that favors the buildup of pests and diseases. It might also encourage the spread of weed seeds. We hope you enjoyed this lesson.

       " \"Take a look at this huge farmland. What do you see? Can you see long rows of crops separated by rows of water? What do you think is going on here? A form of irrigation is taking place in this farmland, and it's called surface irrigation. Do you recall that in our introductory lesson to irrigation, we mentioned that there are three types of irrigation systems: surface irrigation, subsurface irrigation, and overhead irrigation? In the surface irrigation system, water from rivers, dams, or streams flows along the surface of the land to the farmland. This is why it is called surface irrigation. It can be done in the form of channels, flooding, contoured ditch furrows (like seen in the image), and basins. This type of irrigation system is ideal for gentle slopes and won't work well for hills. \\n\\nSurface irrigation has quite a number of advantages. One of the major advantages is that it is easy to set up and cheap to maintain. Many farmers opt for this method because of this, especially when there is a body of water close by. Surface irrigation also removes excess water caused by every rainfall and prevents the accumulation of alkaline. It also increases the activities of microbes in the soil. Unfortunately, like many good things, surface irrigation has disadvantages as well. Like I mentioned earlier, it is not ideal for hilly areas. It will also not be successful in sandy soil. Sometimes the volume of water from flooding cannot be controlled, and some crops cannot tolerate heavy flooding. \\n\\nSurface irrigation is a great irrigation system, but all the important factors must be put into consideration before opting for it.

My mother asked why the pipes were on the floor, and she was told it was an irrigation system. Amanda knew that irrigation was simply the artificial application of water to farmland, but she had never used the system before. Uncle explained that this system was called a subsurface irrigation system, and it involved applying water below the surface of the soil through perforated pipes. In our previous lesson, we looked at surface irrigation, where we said that water flows from dams or rivers to the surface of the soil. In subsurface irrigation, however, the water is delivered below the soil surface through capillary actions by perforated pipes carrying water. Subsurface irrigation has its own advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages is that water can be maintained at the optimum depth for crop needs. It also enables water to be used efficiently, unlike surface irrigation where water might be wasted. It also ensures low evaporation losses from the soil. However, unlike surface irrigation, subsurface irrigation is expensive and requires some form of technical know-how. Also, water with high salt contents can be used, as it could be injurious to the soil. We hope you have enjoyed the lesson so far and we look forward to seeing you in the next one.\",\n",

It turns out that someone had turned on the sprinklers. Do you know what sprinklers are? They are part of a larger system called overhead irrigation, in which water is supplied to the farmland above the surface of the soil. We have already discussed both surface and subsurface irrigation, and now we want to look at overhead irrigation. There are two types of overhead irrigation: drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation. In subsequent lessons, we'll look at both types of overhead irrigation, but today we want to focus on some of the problems associated with using overhead irrigation. The wind can cause an uneven distribution of water by distorting the sprinkler pattern. Water was able to splash on me as well due to the effect of the wind. The spray force might also damage some soft fruits. Overhead irrigation might also lead to the spread of diseases. Unlike surface irrigation, overhead irrigation is expensive to set up, requires technical know-how, and is expensive to maintain. This form of irrigation has a high cost of repair and spare parts. It also has a high power requirement for pumping water, which does not make it ideal for small or growing farms. In addition, it would require a stable water supply.

Water is sprayed from their nozzles under pressure into the air, which then falls onto the ground like rain. We established in our last lesson that sprinkler irrigation is a type of overhead irrigation. As expensive as it is to set up and maintain, sprinkler irrigation has a number of advantages. Some of which are: the amount of water supplied can be regulated, which economizes the use of water. It is suitable for crops with a high evapotranspiration rate and can be used for all crops except for three crops because of their height. It also enables soluble fertilizers and herbicides to be sprayed in addition to the irrigation water. Sprinkler irrigation also has some disadvantages, some of which we discussed in our last lesson. It is expensive to operate and maintain, and the power requirement is also very high and might be unavailable. Oftentimes, there's a lack of sufficient technical knowledge on running the sprinkler irrigation. In our next lesson, we'll be looking at another type of overhead irrigation called the drip irrigation system. See you then, thank you.\",\n",
       " \"Ronald's farm uses the drip irrigation system. Although it may resemble subsurface irrigation, it is different. In this system, water is discharged through emitters or driplets attached to long pipes at selected intervals to deliver water to the soil surface at the base of the plant. This is unlike subsurface irrigation, where the pipes are simply perforated and water is delivered below the soil surface. In our previous lesson, we looked at sprinkler irrigation as a type of overhead irrigation. Today, we will be discussing another type of overhead irrigation, which is drip irrigation. Drip irrigation is cost-effective, just like sprinkler irrigation, and it reduces salt concentration in the root zone. Fertilizers can also be applied through the system. It works well in slower than arid areas. However, just like sprinkler irrigation, it is expensive to set up and maintain. This system will not work well for sloppy farmland. Water with high salt content cannot be used either. We have come to the end of our discussion on the types of overhead irrigation. We hope you have enjoyed the lessons so far.

Imagine my surprise when I visited him today and found him and his family members attempting to water the plants by pouring buckets of water on the soil. They looked exhausted, and that wasn't surprising because Abubakar's farm is very large. Also, they were damaging some of the crops because the impact of the water they were pouring on the soil was too much.\\n\\nI had to pull Abubakar to the side and ask him why he wasn't using any irrigation system, which is more efficient and effective, I told him. But he told me that there were too many problems associated with irrigation. This began a conversation on the problems facing irrigation.\\n\\nOne problem facing irrigation is that sometimes there is inadequate water supply. Abubakar told me that there was no nearby body of water, and because of the season, the wells had dried up. He also mentioned that irrigation equipment is expensive, and setting up requires technical know-how that is sometimes unavailable.\\n\\nThis got me thinking. I could only comfort Abubakar. There are several other problems associated with irrigation, such as an increase in disease-causing organisms with increased immunity. Vectors such as snails and tsetse flies also breed freely in irrigation areas. Pests from surrounding areas may invade irrigated areas and damage crops. Irrigation also frequently involves pipes and other equipment, such as spring clamps, which may affect the free flow of farm machinery on the farmland.\\n\\nIn our next lesson, we'll be looking at how to reduce disease spread through irrigation on farmland. See you then, Foreign.\",\n",
       " 'Abakka has decided to stop irrigating his farmland. He made this decision after discovering that irrigation was aiding the spread of disease-causing organisms on his farmland. He noticed that vectors were breathing freely, and diseases were being spread among his crops. However, he is finding it difficult to stand by his decision as his family is too big, and he cannot manually water all the crops. Do you think there is anything Abakka can do in this situation? Yes, there is. There are ways to reduce the spread of diseases that are spread through irrigation on the farm. Disease-resistant varieties of crops should be planted, and crop rotation can be practiced as well. A shockproof way of reducing disease spread is by using appropriate chemicals to kill disease-causing organisms. Farmers like Abakka must also ensure that they use clean tools and other healthy planting materials. It also helps to destroy infected crops immediately to prevent the spread of diseases. It is also important to avoid excess irrigation and control the growth of weeds on the farm. We hope you enjoyed this lesson. See you in the next one.',\n",
       " \"I want you to imagine a house without any form of drainage. Let's assume the house was built without any gutters or any form of drainage. What would happen in the event of a flood? Of course, water wouldn't be able to leave the compound. It would force its way into the apartment, destroying things. This is because ideally, every house should have an outlet for excess water to pass through. When this outlet is absent, then everywhere gets flooded. The same thing happens on farmland when there aren't drainage facilities put in place. \\n\\nSo, what exactly is drainage and why is it so important? Drainage is the process whereby excess water in the soil is removed artificially to promote good farming activities. Drainage is important because it helps in regaining waterlogged soil for crop production. It also improves soil structure and water-holding capacity of the soil. Another importance of drainage is that it makes tillage operations easier and reduces the spread of crop diseases. It makes land preparation easier, reduces soil acidity, increases soil temperature, and crop production. Drainage also improves soil aeration, which helps in good root respiration. \\n\\nIn our next lesson, we'll be looking at the types of drainage, so stay tuned.\",\n",
       " \"In our last lesson, we established that drainage is the artificial removal of excess water from the soil in order to promote good farming activities. There are two types of drainage: surface drainage and subsurface drainage. Surface drainage is the type of drainage system that you can see right on the surface of the soil, while subsurface drainage is an underground drainage system. If you remember correctly, this is not the first time we are discussing surface and subsurface classifications. Irrigation can also be surface or subsurface. In this lesson, we'll be looking at surface drainage. \\n\\nSo, what is surface drainage? Surface drainage is the orderly removal of excess water artificially from the surface of the slope using constructed open ditches, field drains, and land grading. Surface drainage is commonly used because it is easier and cheaper to construct in comparison to subsurface drainage. However, it has a few disadvantages. The surface drainage occupies good land space that could have been used for planting. It hinders the passage of machines like tractors and is prone to girly erosion. Surface drainage also requires frequent maintenance and impairs farm mechanization. \\n\\nWe hope you enjoyed this lesson!\",\n",

It is very possible that the farm is operating an underground drainage system. In our previous lesson, we referred to the underground draining system as subsurface drainage. Subsurface drainage is the orderly removal of excess water from the land using tiles, molds, or perforated pipes dug under the ground. It is also referred to as underground drainage. Subsurface drainage has a good number of advantages over the surface drainage system. It does not pose any threat to machines, high-value crops can be grown, it leaves the field free from surface obstruction, and the cost of maintenance is low. Unlike the surface drainage system, subsurface drainage is also faster and more efficient. As we mentioned before, it leaves more land available for cultivation. However, subsurface drainage is expensive to operate, it is not easily constructed, and requires a deep excavation of the soil.

They claim that it saves them money and time in clearing their farms, as they don't have to pay a multitude of laborers to come and clear the farms. While this practice may be beneficial to them at times, it often results in negative consequences. Today, we will examine bush burning as a farming practice to determine if it has any benefits, as the farmers in Gyro community claim it does, and what the potential consequences are. \\n\\nBush burning involves setting a fire on the bushes to clear out the vegetation. It does have a number of benefits, such as releasing potassium and phosphorus as ash, sterilizing the soil by killing harmful bacteria, stimulating the growth of fresh grass, and destroying soil-borne pathogens and weed seeds. However, the negative effects of bush burning far outweigh the benefits. Over time, it destroys the organic content of the soil and reduces the population of helpful soil life organisms. It also exposes the soil to erosion and leaching, raises the pH level of the soil, leads to environmental pollution, destroys the soil structure, and reduces the water content. \\n\\nWithout a doubt, it is best not to engage in bush burning.

This scenario is known as overgrazing, and it is a situation where more animals than the pasture can support are put to graze. \\n\\nOvergrazing has a few benefits, such as the fact that more feces can be dropped from the animals, which could improve the fertility of the soil. Also, weeds can easily be eradicated from the land. However, as expected, overgrazing would deplete the vegetative cover of the soil. It causes poor growth and regenerative capacity of the vegetation. Overgrazing also exposes the soil to erosion and destroys the soil structure.

Remy is concerned that the topsoil may be removed, and the fertility of the soil will be reduced. Cooler and Remy are so confused that they have come to you for advice on what to do. \\n\\nAs for clean clearing, it is the complete removal of vegetation on a piece of land. One good thing about clean clearing is that it gets rid of weeds from the land and leaves it free from obstacles. However, clean clearing leads to the disturbance or removal of the topsoil. It also leads to more evaporation of water from the soil, thereby reducing the water content in the soil. Clean clearing exposes the soil to erosion and leads to a reduction in organic matter. It also results in a loss of soil nutrients and leads to leaching and destruction of soil structure. \\n\\nIn terms of advice, it is important to consider the long-term effects of clean clearing on the soil. It may be better to opt for alternative methods of clearing that do not involve the complete removal of vegetation.

They also enhance the productivity capacity of the soil and increase the population of microorganisms in the soil, stimulating vegetation growth. However, like every good thing, you have to be careful. Excessive application of fertilizers can cause soil acidity and reduce the activity of soil organisms, hindering the growth of crops. This means that excessive application will do the opposite of what a fertilizer is meant to do. So, fertilizers must be applied in the right quantity and following the right procedure.

Organic manuring involves applying manure such as green manure, farmyard manure, and compost to the soil to improve its fertility. Organic manure returns nutrients to the soil, improves its texture and structure, encourages the activities of soil organisms, and improves the water holding capacity of the soil. It also prevents soil erosion and regulates temperature fluctuations in the soil.\\n\\nHowever, organic manure can have adverse effects on the soil if not used properly, as it may introduce pathogens to the soil.

In fact, it now appears as though he is operating at a loss. He is constantly plagued by the same pests and diseases despite his attempts to get rid of them.

This helps to maintain the fertility of the soil, increases the yield of crops, and maximizes the use of available land.

Anything used continuously without any break is bound to wear out faster than it should. This is the same thing that would happen if a farmer were to continue planting the same crops on a piece of land for several years without any rest or fallow. The soil is not unlimited in its supply of nutrients. The soil can get tired, just like your shoes can get tired. Continuous cropping is the practice of growing the same grain crops on the same piece of land every year without any rest from farming. Today, I will be looking at the farming practice called continuous cropping and discussing its merits and demerits. Cropping allows different crops to be grown and harvested, thereby offering a variety of crops within a short period of time. It also maximizes the use of available land. However, continuous cropping can be very harmful to the soil. It depletes the soil of nutrients and ensures the spread and multiplication of germs. Continuous cropping also ensures the multiplication of pests and diseases and eventually results in low crop yields. So, you can see why continuous cropping is a harmful farming practice.

I would attempt to break the yam into smaller pieces so it can absorb some of the oil, pepper, and other flavors in the pot. Breaking it would also give it the soft and slightly runny consistency I want. The same thing applies to the soil, only that this time it's called tilling. Tillage is a form of land preparation that involves turning the soil and loosening its surface. Tilling of the soil is a very important step in land preparation, and there are several tilling implements that can be used, such as the plow, harrow, and ridge. \\n\\nSo, let's look at the effects of some of these tilling implements on the soil. Plowing increases the soil organic matter content. It helps to mix the soil together and increases the water infusion capacity of the soil. It leads to the compaction of the soil and improves the aeration of the soil. Unfortunately, it could also spread disease-causing organisms in the soil. Harrowing, on the other hand, increases root penetration but may lead to soil erosion and destruction of the soil structure. \\n\\nLike the plow, the harrow also increases aeration and water infiltration. Unlike harrowing, it prevents erosion and improves water penetration. It collects together rich topsoil and improves aeration and root penetration.

My doctor recommended that I take a lot of fluids to try and replenish the lost weight and nutrients. The same thing applies to the soil. There are certain farming practices and factors that influence the loss of nutrients in the soil. It is the responsibility of a farmer to look for ways to replenish the soil nutrients. Today, I will be looking at one of the methods of replenishing soil nutrients, known as crop rotation. Crop rotation is a system of farming whereby different crops are grown on the same piece of land year after year in a definite manner so as to maintain the fertility of the soil. There are principles guiding crop rotation, and I will be looking at some of those principles today. But before that, take a look at this layout of a four-year crop rotation plan. Let's get to the principles of crop rotation. Deep-rooted crops like yam and cassava should not follow each other. Shallow-rooted crops should not follow each other as well. Crops which have the same pest or disease should not follow each other to prevent a continuous attack of the pest and disease on the farm. Crops of the same family should not follow each other as well, and crops which help to control weeds should be planted. It is also important to include legumes in crop rotation. Why is crop rotation important? Are there conditions that might necessitate crop rotation as an ideal practice? Yes, when you have land that is scarce or limited in supply, crop rotation is ideal because it helps to make the best use of the land. When you have a high population, it's best to practice crop rotation as well. When there's a need to have a variety of crops or maintain the fertility of the soil, as discussed earlier, crop rotation should be done.

Even if the food was still consumable, there is a huge possibility that you have destroyed all the nutrients in the food. If you were to eat food like that, you would be consuming food that has barely any nutrients to offer you. Similarly, what if you over-washed your vegetables before cooking? If you kept washing and washing because your mind was somewhere else, it\\'s very possible that you would have washed away some vital nutrients in the vegetable. The same principles could apply to soil farming practices like burning, which destroy the fertility of the soil by destroying its nutrients. Just like burning destroys the nutrients in the pot of food, you can also liken over-washing vegetables to leaching and erosion of the soil. These factors, and more, affect nutrient availability in the soil, and we will be listing some of these factors today. There are several factors that could affect the nutrient availability in the soil. Some of these factors are soil pH, concentration of other nutrients, leaching, crop removal, oxidation and reduction of organic material, and the soil texture. These factors will most likely lead to the loss of soil nutrients. Earlier, we had already mentioned burning, erosion, and leaching as factors that deplete the soil of nutrients. Soil nutrients can also be lost when the soil contains an excess of other nutrients. With this, we have come to the end of our lessons on farming practices.

       " 'Have you ever wondered how soil is formed? When I was younger, I threw a small rock from a huge hill and saw that my rock disintegrated into smaller particles that looked like soil. So, I went home and told everyone that I knew how soil was formed - soil was simply formed by breaking big rocks into smaller particles. It sounded kind of silly to everyone I told, but it turns out that I was right. Soil is actually formed from rocks. The question is, how do these rocks become soil? The breaking occurs through a process known as weathering. Weathering can be defined as the disintegration or breakdown of rocks into tiny particles called soil. Weathering occurs through three major processes: physical, chemical, and biological. The physical process of weathering involves the breakdown of rocks through physical agents such as temperature, water, ice, and pressure. The chemical process of weathering involves chemical reactions like hydration, carbonation, and oxidation and reduction to facilitate weathering. In the biological process of weathering, biological factors like plants and animals facilitate the process of weathering. In subsequent lessons, we will discuss each of these processes of weathering in detail. See you then!',\n",

This made me wonder how so much soil was formed on Earth. I concluded that God sent angels to throw rocks from the skies every day to form soil on Earth. Of course, this idea was silly, but I wasn't entirely wrong. In the previous lesson, we also established that rocks disintegrate to become soil particles through the process of weathering. There are three processes of weathering, one of which is the physical process that we'll be discussing in more detail today. The physical agents involved in the process of weathering are temperature, wind, ice, water, and pressure. So, how exactly do all these work? Temperature causes an alternating heating and cooling of rocks that produces pressure within the rocks and causes them to break into smaller pieces. The wind carries rocks and other solid particles, causing them to drop into the soil. Rocks also contain water, especially inside the cracks. The conversion of this water into ice results in an increase in volume, eventually putting more pressure on these rocks and causing them to break into smaller particles. Running water could also carry some fragments of rocks from the rivers, thus breaking off small pieces. We have come to the end of this lesson. See you in the next one!\",\n",
       " '\"When I was in secondary school, my agricultural science teacher taught us that soil is formed from parent materials, which are rocks. I raised my hand and asked how rocks turn into soil. He explained that rocks break down through the process of weathering, which can be physical, chemical, or biological. He used an illustration to show the different ways rocks can break down. For example, throwing a rock from a building can cause physical weathering, while pouring a chemical on a rock can cause chemical weathering. In this lesson, we will focus on the chemical process of weathering, which involves reactions such as solution, carbonation, hydration, hydrolysis, and oxidation. For example, when water combines with minerals in rocks through hydration, new rocks are formed. Similarly, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can combine with acids to dissolve rocks and form soil. Chemical weathering can also occur when rocks containing iron are oxidized, causing disintegration. Hydrolysis involves breaking down chemical bonds in rock minerals with water. Through these processes, soil is eventually formed. We hope you enjoyed this lesson and look forward to seeing you in the next one.\"',\n",

Let's assume that the farmland is filled with very coarse soil with pieces of rocks here and there. Do you think the activities will contribute to the breaking down of those rocks? Of course, they should, and this is what we refer to as the biological process of weathering. We have established that rocks, also called parent materials, disintegrate to form soil. We also say that there are three major processes of weathering through which this happens, and they are the physical, chemical, and biological processes. Today, we want to look at the biological process in detail. When we talk about biological factors, we are referring to living things like plants, animals, and human beings. Did you know that the activities of living things also aid in the disintegration of rocks to form soil? Let's discuss it. The roots of plants penetrate rocks to form soil. Insects and organisms like earthworms and termites also burrow into the soil and rocks, thereby aiding the disintegration of rocks. Activities of man in tillage cause rocks to break down and form soil as well. So, you see how big an impact biological agents have on the process of soil formation.

During a check of the pH of the soil, Dorin realized that the soil was too acidic, which was impacting the growth of the plants. She then began to think of what to do to rectify the problem. pH is the measure of the degree of acidity and alkalinity of the soil. It can also be defined as a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the soil. You can determine the pH of the soil by using a pH scale. When using a pH scale, note that a pH of 2 is strongly acidic, a pH of 6 is slightly acidic, a pH of 7 is neutral, a pH of 8 is slightly alkaline, and a pH of 13 is strongly alkaline. The things that make soil acidic include the use of acidic fertilizers, acid parent materials, and the presence of sulfur in the soil.

The soil is like a womb for plants, providing the structural support and nutrients needed for the plant to grow. \\n\\nIf I left a seed on my table and opened the windows, the seed would get access to sunlight and water, but it would not grow. This is because it is not in an optimal environment - it is outside its \"womb\". Soil is defined as the unconsolidated or loosely arranged weathered materials found in the uppermost layer of the Earth\\'s surface on which plants grow. There are different types of soil, each with its specific uses and advantages, such as sandy soil, clay soil, and loamy soil. \\n\\nIt\\'s also important to understand the components and composition of soil. Soil mineral matter accounts for 45 percent of the soil, soil water accounts for 25 percent, and soil air accounts for 25 percent. Soil living organisms account for five percent.

       " \"Bobby was six years old when he visited his mum's uncle's farm. He remembered seeing his older sisters using some soil to mold things like bowls and plates, and then pretending to run their own restaurants. Bobby decided to try it out for himself. He always thought it would be fun, but instead of making a bowl or plate, he decided to make a car with the soil. Bobby picked up some soil, but realized that this soil wasn't smooth like the one his sisters had used. The soil had a gritty texture, and he tried to wet it to make it more moldable, but it was all to no avail. Bobby became frustrated and eventually went to sit down with his mom, tired from all his efforts. \\n\\nWhat Bobby didn't know is that there are different types of soils. In a previous lesson, we mentioned the three major types: sandy soil, clay soil, and loamy soil. In today's lesson, we want to discuss sandy soil in detail. We'll be looking at its properties, economic importance, and methods of improving the soil. The soil that Bobby found in his uncle's farm couldn't be molded because it was sandy soil. Sandy soil has properties that do not favor molding. It is quite gritty and grained, loose with large pore spaces, and absorbs and loses water easily. It is not sticky like we've established, and as such, cannot be molded. It is also well-aerated and has a low water-holding capacity. It supports leaching and is low in plant nutrients. It does not support waterlogging and erosion and has a gray or brownish color. \\n\\nBecause sandy soil is low in plant detroit and does not hold water well, it has to be improved if it must be used to plant crops. Ways to improve sandy soil include planting cover crops, applying compost and animal manure, and mulching the soil. Sandy soil is best treated for the cultivation of crops like cassava, granules, and cotton. It is also good in building construction when mixed with cement. It has great properties as a filler. We covered sandy soil extensively in this lesson. In the next one, we'll be looking at clay soil.\",\n",
       " \"Everybody says that Musa is blessed with good soil. He purchased land at the same time as his friend Garba. However, Garba encountered problems due to the type of soil on his farm, while Musa has been enjoying his farmland. Musa's soil has the right amount of nutrients, and whenever it rains, it doesn't take too long for the soil to get dry. Unlike his friend Gariba's farm, which could remain wet for days, the soil of Musa's farmland can easily be worked on or cultivated. It is simply the best soil for the cultivation of crops. Can you guess the type of soil we're talking about? Of course, we are talking about loamy soil. Loamy soil is the best type of soil for the cultivation of crops. How do you identify loamy soil? Loamy soil is dark brown or black in color, unlike other types of soil which are lighter brown or greyish in color. Loamy soil is moist and loose with moderate-sized pore space. It has a non-powdery and non-strict texture. It can be easily worked upon and cultivated, just like we stated about Musa's soil. It also contains lots of organic matter. It does not support waterlogging and erosion. It is well-aerated and holds water well. We hope you enjoyed the lesson. See you in the next one!\",\n",
       " \"When Booty was younger, he had a strong dislike for insects and other crawling things. He would follow his father to the farm and begin killing all the insects he could see. He remembered killing earthworms, termites, and other organisms he didn't even know the names of. In fact, Booty called it his daily mission to kill 100 crawling things in his father's farm every day.\\n\\nOne day, Booty's father caught him and reprimanded him. But Booty was stunned. Who likes insects anyways? Why would Papa be annoyed? Papa then explained to him that the insects he was killing were actually very beneficial to the soil and, in turn, extremely beneficial to the plants. This is because their movement helped in tilling the soil. They also provided organic matter that was necessary for the soil.\\n\\nAre you also like Booty in thinking that insects have no usefulness whatsoever, especially on the farmland? Well, in today's lesson, we hope you change your mind. You see, insects and other soil organisms belong to a collective group that we can refer to as biotic factors. Biotic factors refer to living organisms like plants, trees, bacteria, grass, or molds. Biotic factors are very key in the formation of soil. Simply put, biotic factors are soil-living organisms, and they help speed up the process of soil formation in a good number of ways.\\n\\nTermites, earthworms, and rodents enable the soil to absorb organic matter gotten from leaves, wood, and other things. Soil organisms like earthworms also decompose organic matter, enabling the release of nutrients into the soil. These organisms mix inorganic particles like sand, stone, and clay with organic matter to form soil. In addition, they aerate the soil, making air react with rocks to form soil. When farmers till the soil, they also open up the soil and encourage biotic activity. Microorganisms also produce carbon dioxide, which promotes weathering of rocks. Leaves which fall from trees decay and increase the humus content of the soil.\\n\\nNow do you see why biotic factors are essential in the formation of soil? I'll see you in the next lesson.\",\n",
       " '\"What do you think soil is made of? Do you believe that soil just appears? Well, I hope you don\\'t, especially if you have been following our lessons on factors affecting the formation of soil. Nothing just exists in isolation. Soil is formed from parent materials, which are previously existing rocks. Some examples of these parent materials are igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. The composition of these rocks helps in determining the composition of the soil. Of course, this isn\\'t all soil is made up of, but it contributes to a large part of it. It\\'s important to know that all factors of formation are bound by a common factor, and that is time. It takes a long time for small pieces of rocks to disintegrate into smaller grains of soil. Remember, we mentioned that soil consists of organic matter, which is composed of decayed plant materials. Well, it takes a long time for this process of decay to occur as well. It also takes a while to form rich soil. With this, we have come to the end of our lesson on the factors affecting the formation of soil. See you in the next lesson!\"',\n",
       " \"There are three different plots of land in three different places. One of these lands is on top of a hill, the second one is by the side of the hill, and the last one is below the hill on a level ground. Farrock wants to buy one of them and use it for farming, but he is still considering the location options. He wants to know which site is best for planting. Do you think that the location of any farmland affects the soil? Yes, the location matters, but by location here we mean topography. Topography simply refers to the physical features of the land, including the flatness and steepness of slopes of hills, valleys, and plains. It can also be referred to as the shape of the ground in relation to underlying rocks of the earth's surface. Topography affects the formation and composition of soils. More soils are formed in valleys rather than hills because erosion carries the rocks and soils from above to form rich soils on the ground below. If you remember our lesson on how climatic factors affect formation, then you know that several climatic factors cause the breaking down and weathering of rocks to form soils. Sloping surfaces also support erosion, thus encouraging soil formation. This means that farmland beside a hill will be sloping, and rich soil can be formed. It is also true that the shape of the land affects the movement and amount of water in the soil. Sloping surfaces encourage runoff of water, and water in valleys or flood land can retain water better. We hope that you have enjoyed the lesson. We'll see you in the next one.\",\n",
       " \"Foreign: We all know that human beings need essential nutrients to survive. This is why we talk about a balanced diet and mention vitamins as essential for the growth and development of any human being. But did you know that plants also need nutrients to survive? Yes, they do. Plants need nutrients to survive, and these nutrients can be classified into two categories: macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients are mineral elements or nutrients required by crops in large quantities. Examples of macronutrients are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and sulfur. Micronutrients, on the other hand, are elements or nutrients required by crops in small quantities. Examples of these nutrients are zinc, copper, boron, molybdenum. In our next lesson, we'll be looking at the function and deficiency of some of these nutrients. See you then!\",\n",
       " 'Anthony noticed that his leaves were turning yellow and dropping prematurely, which led him to suspect a nitrogen deficiency. Nitrogen is a vital micronutrient that is important for every aspect of plant growth and yield. It is essential for plant growth and reproduction, as well as promoting vegetative and shoot system growth. Chlorophyll, the green pigment present in all green plants that is essential for photosynthesis, requires nitrogen for its formation. When nitrogen is deficient, plants assume a yellowish color and lose their green color. Nitrogen is also necessary for the synthesis of plant hormones. However, excess nitrogen could delay the maturation and fruiting of crops. When plants lack nitrogen, there is stunted growth and yellowing of leaves, and the leaves tend to drop prematurely, just like Anthony noticed. In subsequent lessons, we will be looking at more macronutrients. We hope you enjoyed this lesson.',\n",

Her uncle asked her to show him the area on the phone, and that was when they both noticed that some of the leaves were turning purple and some of the fruits were dropping, even though they were not yet mature. It eventually turned out that the shrubs were suffering from a deficiency in phosphorus. Phosphorus is a vital macronutrient that is a constituent of cell division and aids enzyme reactions. It also helps increase soil resistance to disease and seed germination, as well as root development and fruit ripening. However, a deficiency of phosphorus will result in a purple or brownish discoloration of leaves, just like Sarah saw. The discoloration will start out as spots before spreading. A phosphorus deficiency will also result in stunted growth and poor root development, just like Sarah's uncle noticed. There might also be an image of fruit drop. With that, we have come to the end of our discussion on the functions and deficiency of phosphorus. See you in the next lesson!```\",\n",

Many of the leaves were shedding, and the plants had stopped growing. A fellow friend told Fabio that he suspected that the shrubs were deficient in some nutrients, as that would explain the brown margins and other symptoms. Potassium is an essential constituent of plant tissues. It aids in the synthesis of carbohydrates and activates various plant enzyme reactions. Potassium also promotes the development of young plants and helps in nitrogen uptake from the soil. A deficiency in potassium, however, leads to weak and slender stems. It also results in delayed growth and leads to premature loss of leaves, just like we saw in our papio plants. An important sign of a deficiency of potassium in plants is the process of brown margins on the leaves. With this, we have come to the end of our lesson on the function and deficiency of potassium.

       " '\"When I was younger, my mom always said I should drink a lot of milk. Do you remember being told to drink milk and eat foods rich in calcium to strengthen your bones and teeth? Well, it turns out that calcium is not only essential for humans but also for plants. Calcium is a macronutrient, which means that plants require it in large quantities. What function does calcium perform in plants? Calcium strengthens plant cells, helps in the translocation and storage of carbohydrates, and maintains balance in seeds and tubers. It is also necessary for the normal growth of root tips and tolerance to the toxicity of aluminum, magnesium, and sodium ions. Additionally, calcium improves soil pH by reducing its acidity. Just like the human body, a deficiency in calcium leads to weakness of the skeletal frame. In the case of plants, they become weak and slender, with stunted root systems and pale yellow leaves. In our next lesson, we\\'ll be looking at the dysfunctions and deficiencies of another macronutrient, magnesium. See you then!\"',\n",

Later, he began to notice that the size of the leaves were reduced and they were shedding unusually. However, what bothered him the most was the paleness and yellowing of the lower leaves in comparison to the upper leaves. While the leaves were turning yellow, the veins were dark green in color. He decided to call in an expert to take a look at the plant, and it was suspected that the plant was suffering from a nutrient deficiency of magnesium. Magnesium is an important macronutrient that must not be overlooked. It is important in the synthesis of carbohydrates as it is a constituent of chlorophyll. It also assists in the transportation of phosphate for fruit and seed development. It enhances plant growth and is required for normal cell division. When the plant is deficient in magnesium, just like these plants were, some things are expected to be seen, such as stunted growth of crops, premature shedding of leaves, and intervening chlorosis. This simply means that, just like described earlier, the veins maintain a deep green color, but in between veins, the plant loses its normal green color. With this, we have come to the end of our discussion on macronutrients. I'll see you in the next lesson.\",\n",

Do you see the animals enjoying themselves, eating to their fill? The land you see covered with green vegetation is called pasture. The green plants you see can be referred to as forage crops. \\n\\nWhat exactly is pasture? Pasture can be defined as a piece of land on which forage crops grow. Forage crops are plants cultivated or grown naturally with vegetable parts. Leaves and stems are fed on by livestock. Now you see why the animals were having a good time. \\n\\nYou would think forage crops are only useful for the animals that feed on them, but that's not true. They are also beneficial to the soil and have lots of other uses. Let's take a look at some of these uses. Forage crops, as we've said, are used as livestock feed. They are used as cover crops which conserve soil moisture. Forage crops also help in controlling weed growth as they barely give any room for weeds. Some of these forage crops are leguminous in nature and enrich soil nutrients. They help in preventing erosion and can also be used for roof thatching, farmstead, and as bedding materials. \\n\\nSo you see now that forage crops are very useful.

We will examine three categories of factors that contribute to this phenomenon: climatic, soil, and biotic factors. The climate of a region plays a significant role in determining the type of vegetation that can grow there. For instance, Sudan's climate is conducive to the growth of saturn grasses and legumes, which may not thrive in equatorial climates. The climatic elements that affect vegetation growth include rainfall, wind, temperature, and relative humidity. Soil ethic factors refer to the level of soil fertility, which can either enhance or hinder pasture growth. These factors include soil pH, texture, structure, and topography. Biotic factors, which are living factors, also impact the distribution of pastures. Human activities such as bush burning and overgrazing can significantly affect the availability of pasture.

What can Rashid do since he doesn't have natural pasture? In our previous lesson, we defined pasture as a piece of land where foreign crops grow and forage crops as plants cultivated for livestock. There are two types of pasture: natural and artificial. Today, we'll be discussing each type and their advantages. Natural pasture, also known as natural grassland or rangeland, is a piece of land where grasses or legumes grow naturally and are fed upon by animals. Unfortunately, Rashid's land doesn't have this, so he would have to go for an artificial pasture. An artificial pasture, also known as an established or sown pasture, is a piece of land where grasses or legumes are cultivated and managed by humans for livestock. Natural pasture has poor quality grasses or legumes and contains some types that are low in fertility or nutrients. It also contains a wide variety of grasses and legumes, some of which will not be consumed by livestock. However, natural pasture has a good regenerative ability and can withstand trampling. Artificial pasture, on the other hand, contains high-quality grasses and legumes, no weeds, and has a high regenerative ability and can withstand trampling by farm animals. Rashid doesn't have to give up on his dreams of establishing a pasture simply because he doesn't have natural pasture. He can simply establish an artificial pasture.

This is similar to how we must offer the right type of food to animals. Not every pasture is good for your livestock, so you must be able to identify a good one. In today\\'s lesson, we will be discussing the qualities of a good pasture land. A good pasture must be able to regenerate quickly after being browsed and withstand trampling.

Forests are not just great for looking at, though. They have several other functions, which is why they must be preserved. In our subsequent lesson, we'll be looking at the importance of forests and their resources. But before then, let's talk a little about forests. A forest is a large area of land covered with trees and bushes, either growing wild or planted for specific purposes, which serve as a habitat for various kinds of animals. Forestry is the management of forests and forest resources. Tree cultivation is the growing and cultivation of trees. Forest ecology, on the other hand, is the scientific study of interrelated organisms in the forest. Common forest trees found in Nigeria include Iroko, Ochebe, Mahogany, Nigerian Wall North, Iboni Ebony, Carmund, or Afaratik. You know, I mentioned earlier that forests must be preserved. One of the ways of doing that is through forest reserves. Forest reserves are large areas of land where plants either grow naturally or are planted specifically and are especially preserved for specific purposes. Some forest reserves in Nigeria are Mammal River Forest Reserve in Anambra State, Orma Forest Reserve in Ogun State, Afi Forest Reserve in Cross River State, Oklahoma Forest Reserve in Edo State, Shasha River Forest Reserve in Oyo State, Zamfara Forest Reserve in Zamfara State, and Sangha River Forest Reserve in Plateau State.

At first, I didn't understand why it was so important, but the speaker explained that cutting down trees and destroying forests have adverse effects on the community. Deforestation contributes to global warming, which is responsible for devastating climatic changes. In our previous lesson, we discussed several other reasons why forests are important. Today, we will focus on forest management. The government has observed that the demolition of forests does more harm than good and has put measures in place to protect them. One of these measures is forest regulation, which includes laws, decrees, and bylaws to prevent people from exploiting or indiscriminately tapping resources. Some of these regulations include the prohibition of bush burning, the ban on indiscriminate cutting of timber trees, and the ban on collecting leaves and firewood from the forest. There is also a ban on farming in forest reserves and cutting down of under a trees. The government also encourages people to plant trees and has made it necessary for people to obtain licenses to cut down trees for human needs. Another management practice that helps in the preservation of forests is selective exploration. Selective exploration involves the preservation of mature trees in the forest for continuous supply. It protects the soil from erosion, ensures a continuous supply of timber, and serves as a revenue base for the government. It also prevents the indiscriminate felling of timber.

My mom said it was becoming a nuisance, so she cut it. I was disappointed and angry with her for a while, but I didn't give up. I planted another one. The whole experience taught me that you can always start again. This lesson will focus on ways to revive forests through two means: regeneration and afforestation. \\n\\nRegeneration is the process of regrowing a forest after it has been exploited. It is a deliberate effort to grow trees. There are two types of regeneration: natural and artificial. Natural regeneration is less expensive compared to artificial regeneration. It does not require formal studies, implantation, or special management skills. It brings about the stabilization of the natural ecosystem. Artificial regeneration, on the other hand, involves planting new forest seedlings in a deforested area. \\n\\nAfforestation is the establishment of forest plantations in areas that have not had forests before. It has several advantages, including the addition of organic matter, a regular supply of raw materials, and easy timber for industries. It also prevents desert enrichment, increases forest foreign wildlife in the area concerned, and prevents the leaching of plant nutrients. Afforestation also increases soil moisture retention and improves the soil structure. Let's not forget how trees contribute to the amount of rainfall in the place.

These plants are cross-planted side by side with the trees. This phenomenon does not occur in every forest. In fact, it is only seen under the Tangent System of Farming. \\n\\nWhat is the Tangent System of Farming? This is defined as the planting of arable crops at an early stage of forest establishment. Then, the arable crops are harvested before the trees form canopies. What this means is that farmers plant certain types of crops, such as wheat and maize, in the forest for a period of time alongside the trees. Then, they harvest these crops before the trees grow to form canopies and move to another location where there are younger trees that have not formed canopies. \\n\\nThere are certain conditions necessary for the practice of the Tangent System. Some of these conditions are scarcity of land, overpopulation, unemployment, government policies, and a low standard of living. \\n\\nTangent farming has a good number of advantages. In Tangent farming, you can harvest a variety of crops. The crops can be made available throughout the year, and it solves the problem of land scarcity.

In her essay writing for school about her last holiday experience, she stated that she enjoyed the vacation a lot, especially the camel ride at the Desert Safari, but mentioned that the weather there was hot. This is because the Desert Safari is a region with high temperatures and low rainfall. The Desert Safari is a type of terrestrial habitat referred to as a desert. Terrestrial habitats consist of land and other dry environments. Organisms of the land are called terrestrial organisms. They include plants and animals that are found living on the ground. There are different types of terrestrial habitats, which are marshes, forests, arid land or desert, and grassland or savannah. A marsh is also called a swamp. A marsh is a lowland flooded in the rainy season and usually waterlogged because of poor drainage. When ponds and lakes are filled up with soil and organic debris of plants, marshes can also be formed. A forest is a community of plants dominated by tall trees like Eroko, Obichi, and Mahogany, with abundant rainfall. Most forest animals, such as monkeys, squirrels, birds, and bats, live in trees, while some, such as millipedes, ants, and snails, live among the litters on the ground.

The floodwaters entered Mr. Laby's apartment, destroying their personal belongings and polluting their water reservoir with dirty water. This was caused by the waste that had blocked the drainage system, resulting in the flood.

       " \"During festive seasons like Christmas, many families visit the beach due to its popularity. The beach is a type of aquatic habitat known as the marine habitat, where organisms such as plants, microorganisms, and animals are naturally found. An aquatic habitat is a place where certain organisms live naturally, and the beach is a good example of this. Marine habitats, such as the beach, occupy 70% of the earth's total surface area and have high salinity and density due to the dissolved salt. This allows many organisms to float in it, including sea turtles, whales, and silves. The popular third mainland bridge in Lagos, Nigeria, crosses the Lagos lagoon that connects Lagos mainland to Lagos island. A lagoon is a type of aquatic habitat referred to as an estuarine or brackish habitat. Unlike the marine habitat, such as the beach that contains only saltwater, the estuarine or brackish water occurs when salty water from the beach mixes with fresh water from the land. In estuarine habitats, such as lagoon, delta, and bay, the salinity fluctuates. Small bodies of inland water like ponds, rivers, and swamps with shallow and still water that have very low or no salt are referred to as freshwater habitats. In summary, the aquatic habitat is divided into three main types of habitats, namely marine or saltwater habitat, brackish or estuarine water habitat, and freshwater habitat that contains little or no salt.

       " \"Why do some animals have bones while others don't? For example, earthworms do not have bones like goats and cows. Instead, they possess a hard shell that covers their body. This is because living organisms, including plants and animals, possess different types of materials within or outside their bodies that serve as support systems to protect them. This support system is also known as the skeletal system. Several animals, like the earthworm, snail, and human, possess different types of skeletal systems. Animals like earthworms have a muscular body wall that is filled with fluid to support themselves. This is called a hydrostatic skeleton. Snails have a shell outside that acts as an outer skeleton covering the body, enabling them to move about. This is called an exoskeleton. Humans have bones of many sizes and shapes inside their bodies, providing support, shape, and protection to soft tissues and organs. This is called an endoskeleton. A skeleton is the framework of the body that provides support, shape, and protection to soft tissues and organs. In plants, supporting tissues provide strength, rigidity, definite shape, and resistance against external forces such as wind. Enjoy and see you in the next class. Thank you.\",\n",

Now, whenever a child's tooth falls out, they are told to throw it onto the roof of the house so that it will grow again. Funny, right? We didn't know how it worked, but because we were told to do it, we had no choice. Well, the teeth of every child fall out around age five or six to make way for the adult teeth, which are permanent teeth. Most children develop a full set of 20 milk teeth as a baby. Human beings have two sets of teeth, which are 20 in number, and they later fall out to be replaced by the second set of teeth that are 32. This is called dental dentition, which is the number arrangement of teeth in an organism. For human beings, the total number of teeth is 32. Dogs have 42, cows have 32, lions have just 30, rabbits have 28, sheep have 32, and rats have 16. The mammalian teeth are made up of four major types of teeth called incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. The incisors are the flat, chisel-shaped teeth used for biting food and holding onto prey to prevent it from escaping. The canines have a sharp and pointed tip for tearing flesh and catching prey. The premolars and molars are the large, rigid teeth with flat surfaces used for grinding and chewing food. Thank you for your time. Enjoy and see you in the next class!\",\n",
       " 'If you have been paying attention, you would have noticed that living things feed on different types of food. Some feed on plants, while others prefer raw or uncooked food. For example, insects like grasshoppers feed on leaves, while animals like earthworms feed on soil containing food. This is because living organisms all have a different system that helps them break down the type of food that the animal consumes into a simple and absorbable form for use by the animal. This system is called the digestive system.\\n\\nThe digestive system of the earthworm is a tube with two openings, which begins from the mouth through which the food enters and the anus through which the undigested food leaves the body. However, this is not the case for some other organisms such as hydra that captures its food and then passes it into the mouth where digestive enzymes mix with it and digests the food. The digested food is absorbed into the body while the undigested food is released through the mouth.\\n\\nThe digestive system includes the elementary tract or canal and all the organs and glands associated with the digestion and assimilation of food. In animals, the alimentary canal of man includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, small intestine or ilium, casium, appendix, large intestine or colon, rectum, and anus. Digestion is the breakdown of the large molecules of food into simple and absorbable form for use by the animals. Enjoy and see you in the next class. Thank you.',\n",

Those who were close to her feared losing out on the benefits and tried to prevent others from getting closer to her. This wealth of connections can be compared to the force exerted by the nuclear charge, which is the force of attraction that electrons have towards the nucleus. This force of attraction increases across the groups as the nuclear charge increases. The shielding of Tosin from becoming friends with more people can be likened to the screening effect of electrons, which is constant across the periods and increases down the group. Today, we have learned that the nuclear charge exerts a force of attraction on the electrons towards the nucleus. This force of attraction increases across the periods as the nuclear charge increases. Inertial electrons screen the nuclear charge from exerting its force of attraction outwards towards the other electrons. Also, inertial electrons screen the nuclear charge from exerting its force of attraction towards the outer electrons. The screening effect is constant across each period but increases down the groups. The overall effects of these are that the effect of increasing nuclear charge overpowers the screen effect of inertial electrons across a period. The screen effect of inertial electrons overpowers the effect of increasing nuclear charge down to groups. These effects are the reasons for the periodic variation in the properties of elements.

It tends to increase as they move from a lower class to a higher class. This trend is similar to the trend in the chemical properties of elements in the periodic table. For example, chemical reactivity, compound thermal stability, and ease of formation of ions also exhibit a trend. Chemical reactivity decreases from group 1 to group 3 for metals and increases from group 4 to group 7 for nonmetals across the period, while it increases down the groups for metals and decreases down the group for non-metals. Compound thermal stability decreases from group 1 to group 3 for metals and increases from group 4 to group 7 for nonmetals across the period.

On the periodic table, elements placed diagonally between group 2 and group 3 have some similarities and properties. That's an intriguing thought! The chemistry of lithium has similarities to that of magnesium, and the chemistry of beryllium has similarities to that of aluminium. Similarly, the chemistry of boron has similarities to that of silicon. Quite interesting, right? So, we have learned that the similarity in properties observed between two elements placed diagonally from each other, from left to right in between adjacent periods and two adjacent groups in the periodic table, is known as diagonal relationship. The diagonal relationship is prominent among the lighter members of the second and the third periods of the element in the periodic table. Diagonal relationships are formed due to the identical size of atoms as we move towards the right across a period in the periodic table. Then, the size of the atom reduces, and when we move downward across a group, the size of the atom gradually increases. Lithium and magnesium form only normal oxides, whereas sodium forms peroxide, and metals below sodium, in addition, form peroxides.

The theory proposes that when an electrolyte is melted or dissolved in water, some, if not all, of the molecules of the substance dissociate into freely moving charged particles called ions. The process of dissociation into ions is known as ionization. Let's talk about the Arrhenius theory. We have the equation to show that sodium chloride gives you sodium ions and chloride ions.

If you answer incorrectly, your score is -3. If you were the first to answer but took more than five seconds, your score is 7. Just like the Al-Aquija Mathematics Competition, elements and compounds also have rules for determining their oxidation numbers. The oxidation number of all uncombined elements is zero. For example, if you have sodium and chlorine, the oxidation number of sodium is +1 and the oxidation number of chlorine is -1. The oxidation number of an ion consisting of a single element is the same as the ionic charge on it. The oxidation number of an ion consisting of more than one element, such as a radical, is the algebraic sum of the oxidation number of all the elements in that ion. For example, the oxidation number of OH- is -1, as the oxidation number of oxygen is -2 and the oxidation number of hydrogen is +1. The oxidation number of a neutral compound is zero, and it is the algebraic sum of the oxidation number of all the elements in that compound. For example, the oxidation number of MgCl2 is zero, as the oxidation number of magnesium is +2 and the oxidation number of chlorine is -1 (multiplied by 2). Today, we have learned that to assign an oxidation number to an element or a compound, there are a set of rules that must be followed. They include the oxidation number of all uncombined elements being zero, the oxidation number of an ion consisting of a single element being the same as the ionic charge on it, and the oxidation number of an ion consisting of more than one element being the algebraic sum of the oxidation number of all the elements in that ion.

Let's try that out. Find the oxidation number of the manganese atom in KMnO4 and give the IUPAC name of the compound. \\n\\nThe solution is that the oxidation number of a neutral compound is zero, so we have KMnO4 equal to zero plus one for K, Mn is unknown, plus four into brackets minus two which is for the oxygen, and equal to zero. So, we have +1 + Mn - 8 = 0. Mn - 7 = 0. Mn is equal to +7. Therefore, the oxidation number, which is also the state of manganese in KMnO4, is +7. Hence, the IUPAC name of the compound is potassium tetraoxomanganate(VII). \\n\\nIsn't that neat? Let's try another one.

This demonstrates that reading culture can be measured through math scores. \\n\\nSimilarly, redox reactions can be identified by changes in oxidation numbers.

Write the half equations for oxidation and reduction, balance the atoms and charges for each equation, and make sure that the loss of electrons in the oxidation half equation is balanced by the electrons gained in the reduction half equation.

One very important reason is that all living things grow and after a definite period of time, they die. But before death, they try to continue their species by giving birth to organisms like themselves using a process known as reproduction. This process takes place with the help of a system known as the reproductive system. The reproductive system of living organisms has different structures and characteristic features that make the process of reproduction for the continuity of that race or group possible. The young ones also feed, grow, and reproduce again. For example, in humans, the male reproductive system is different from that of females. The male reproductive system consists of structures like the testis that produce the sperm, which is the male sex cell, and the penis, which is for the introduction of the sperm into the vagina of the female animal. The female reproductive system consists of the ovaries that produce the egg, which is the female sex cell, the womb, also called the uterus, where the embryo develops, and the vagina that receives the sperm and also serves as the birth canal.

Similarly, succession occurs in nature and initiates the colonization of new areas. For example, bare ground and areas destroyed by fire, wind, or natural disasters are colonized by new species of organisms. Over time, these changes allow other species better suited to the habitat to succeed the old species until a stable community is formed. This orderly change in the inhabitants of an area over time is known as ecological succession. Ecological succession is important for the growth and development of the ecosystem.

       " \"Ugochi, a brilliant young girl, noticed that the bigger fish in her parents' pond were killing and eating the smaller ones. She was worried because her parents had invested a lot into it, so she decided to ask questions from her agricultural science teacher in school. With the information she gathered, she was able to come up with predictions about the probable cause of these incidents. She predicted that it could be because the fish were not getting enough food or the pond was too small. She then decided to persuade her parents to get another pond and also buy more fish meal. The bigger fishes were separated from the smaller ones, and food was increased from once daily to three times daily. The killing stopped immediately. This was confirmation that the cause of killing was due to overcrowding and food shortage in the pond. The situation which occurs when the population in a given habitat increases beyond the point where the resources in that habitat, such as space and food, are not enough to support all the individuals in the population is called overcrowding. When the available food in the habitat is rapidly eaten up due to overcrowding, it eventually leads to food shortage. Enjoy, and I'll see you in the next class!\",\n",
       " '\"Why is it important to take care of the ecosystem? Insufficient food can lead to starvation and eventually death, which can reduce the existence of some species. If there is enough food, space, and oxygen for all living organisms, it means a healthy ecosystem. The balance of nature ensures the stability of organisms in the environment, which is referred to as balance in nature. Humans play a major role in maintaining the balance in the ecosystem. While the oldest belief was that the gods provide balance of nature, the truth is that nature requires humanitarian aid for its maintenance. It is now our duty to protect our environment. For example, we are aware that trees and plants make oxygen and keep air cool, so we can have an ideal environment. Therefore, activities that disturb the balance of nature, like cutting down trees, should be stopped, and more trees should be planted. The balance in nature is a concept that describes the state of equilibrium between living organisms like human beings, plants, and animals, and the environment. It is also referred to as ecological balance. The environment is our home and our food source, and we would have a hard time surviving in it if we do not preserve it by managing natural resources, reusing and recycling materials, and protecting water bodies by preventing people from polluting them with waste.

       " \"The scholar, who wasn't so good at mathematics, loved frequency. She got excited with the fact that you had to represent a number with tally marks. To indicate a frequency of five, you cross four tally marks, as represented in the picture. Tally marks are used in mathematics to represent numbers. The slash is used to write a cell notation for an electrochemical cell. A single slash indicates a metal and metal ion interface, while a double slash shows the presence of a salt bridge. To reinforce this point, a cell notation written as X/X^n+//Y^n+/Y shows an interface between X and X ion, and then we have the Y ion and Y respectively. It doesn't stop there. The double slash shows that there is a short bridge between the X and X ion electrode and the Y in Y ion electrode. Note that the anodic half-cell is always written on the left-hand side, while the cathodic half-cell is always written on the right-hand side. Today we have learned that a typical metallic electrode, which is symbolically represented as M in the solid state/M^+ that is in the ionic state or M in its ionic state/M in the solid phase for metals dipped into the solution of their own ions, can be sufficiently explained by a cell notation without drawing. For example, we have X/X^+//Y^+ and Y. The single vertical lines represent metal and metal-ion interface, while the double lines, that is the slash-slash, represent the salt bridge or a porous partition. So, for example, we have zinc solid plus copper two ions giving us zinc two ions plus copper in the solid state. The cell notation for the system is zinc|zinc two plus/salt bridge|copper two plus|copper. Since zinc is higher up in the electrochemical series, it will serve as the anode, while copper two serves as the cathode. The anodic half-cell is always written on the left-hand side, while the cathodic half-cell is always written on the right-hand side. The diagram below shows the drawing of the above electrochemical cell. I'm sure you enjoyed today's lesson. See you in the next one.\",\n",

       " \"Moses was a great leader. His story begins with his birth, which was quite unusual. Imagine hearing the doorbell and finding a baby wrapped in a basket at your doorstep. That's exactly what happened to Pharaoh's daughter when she found a baby by the riverbank where she was going to have a bath. In Exodus 1:8-22, we learn that Pharaoh was new and knew nothing about Joseph and the people of Israel. He felt threatened by their numbers and decided to reduce their population. His first step was to increase their workload and give limited resources to get the work done. Then he instructed two midwives to kill all the male babies at birth. However, the midwives feared God and told Pharaoh that the women gave birth before they arrived. Furious, Pharaoh ordered that all male children born to the Hebrews be thrown into the river. In Exodus 2:1-10, we find that during that period, a certain Hebrew wife gave birth to a beautiful and healthy child. She hid the baby for three months until it was impossible for her to hide him any longer. So she got a basket covered with items to prevent water from sipping through, set the baby in it, and placed it carefully by the riverbank. Then she asked his elder sister Miriam to stay at a safe distance and watch to see if anyone would come around. Pharaoh's daughter found the baby and decided to raise him as her own. This lesson teaches us that with determination, there's hardly anything that cannot be achieved.\",\n",

       " 'In the previous lesson, we learned about how baby Moses\\' life was saved for three months until Pharaoh\\'s daughter found him at the riverbank. When she discovered that he was one of the Hebrew sons, she had compassion on the baby and held him. Miriam, Moses\\' sister, was waiting nearby to see what would happen to him. As soon as she saw that the princess was drawn to the baby, she seized the opportunity and offered to help find a wet nurse to look after him. And who was this wet nurse? Well, you guessed it, the mother of the child. The princess named him Moses, meaning \"drawn out of the water,\" and raised the boy with the help of the wet nurse in the Egyptian palace. Moses, who could have been killed, was raised as an Egyptian prince, although he hated how the Hebrews were maltreated by the Egyptians.\\n\\nThen, in Exodus 2:11-15, Moses committed a crime. He killed an Egyptian who he saw beating a Hebrew man and secretly buried him in the sand. The following day, he found two Hebrew men fighting and tried to separate them. While he was doing this, he was confronted with his crime, and one of the men said, \"Do you want to kill me just like you killed the other Egyptian?\" Moses realized that what he had done was no longer a secret and became very afraid. Eventually, Pharaoh heard of this incident and was going to kill him. This made Moses run for his life.\\n\\nSo far, we have learned that Pharaoh hated the children of Israel and wanted to reduce their population by oppressing them with hard labor and killing their male children. Pharaoh\\'s daughter saved Moses when she found him by the riverbank. Moses was raised in the palace but had compassion for his Hebrew brothers. Moses fled Egypt when Pharaoh found out he had killed an Egyptian while helping a Hebrew. In the next lesson, we will learn about the calling of Moses into leadership. See you then!',\n",
       " 'In the last lesson, we learned about Moses fleeing Egypt because Pharaoh wanted to kill him for killing an Egyptian who was oppressing a Hebrew. Phil may have regretted not killing the Hebrew boy when his daughter brought him to the palace. Moses left Egypt and went to the land of Midian where he lived with Jethro the priest and worked as a shepherd. Jethro gave him his daughter Zipporah as his wife and they had a son named Gershom, which means \"I am a sojourner in the land.\" In Exodus 3:1-4 and 31, we learn about God\\'s call to Moses. One day, while leading the flock to the holy mountain, Moses had an encounter with God. He saw a burning bush that wasn\\'t actually burning and decided to take a closer look. God called out to him and told him three things. First, Moses needed to take off his sandals because he was on holy ground. Second, God identified himself as the God of his forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Lastly, God told Moses that he had seen the afflictions of the children of Israel by the Egyptians and was ready to set them free. Moses was to return to Egypt and tell Pharaoh to let the children of God go. This marked the beginning of Moses\\' life as a leader to the children of Israel, as ordained by God. To recap, Moses fled Egypt as a fugitive and became a shepherd in the house of Jethro the priest of Midian. He had an encounter with God on the mountain of Horeb, where God told him to return to Egypt and tell Pharaoh to let the people go. In the next lesson, we will learn about his experience as a leader. Bye for now!',\n",
       " 'Foreign, have you ever cared for a hungry friend and offered them something to eat? If yes, then it shows that you truly care. Bravo! You care for anyone you find interesting, right? God was interested in the welfare of the Israelites, so He showed them love by caring for them in various ways. He provided food for them from Heaven, which is called Manna, when they complained that they were hungry. Also, when they reached a place in their journey where there was a lack of water, God made water available for them from a rock through Moses, as God instructed him to strike it. However, Moses named the place Masha or Meribah because the Israelites mumbled against God there and questioned His presence with them. We have learned that: \\n1. God never gets tired of answering prayers. \\n2. God lacks nothing, so He provides for us what we request at our request. \\n3. God provides for us daily because He is our Shepherd. \\n4. God protects us from evil when we serve Him faithfully. \\n5. We cannot do anything without God, so He allows us to lack some things to prove Himself in our lives. \\n6. Sometimes, God tolerates our mistakes to show us to what extent He loves us and cares about us. Thank you and bye for now.',\n",
       " '\"When you give instructions and people follow them and listen to you without being forced, it simply means you have leadership qualities. Moses had some leadership qualities, but he never knew it. God made him a leader of the Israelites when He called him at the burning bush. Although Moses tried to escape the leadership position because he felt he was not qualified, God chose and empowered him with some signs for him to know it was God who had called him into leadership. The signs God gave him were: his rod changed into a snake and turned back into a rod when he took it; Moses\\' hand became leprous when he put it under his armpit, and he became healed again when he withdrew it. Lastly, God instructed Moses to take some water from the river and pour it on the ground, and the water turned to blood. The last sign was to be shown to the people, even if they did not believe the first two, they should believe the last one. \\n\\nSometimes we are given an assignment to do, and we are looking for someone to help us. Aaron, the brother of Moses, was chosen by God to assist him in leadership, and with Aaron\\'s assistance, the assignment was quite easy for Moses. You know something? It takes two to tango. Moses\\' assignment was to deliver the Israelites from the bondage of Egypt to the promised land, the land of Canaan. Moses and Aaron got this task done by cooperation and following strictly to God\\'s instructions. When we follow instructions attached to any given task, it makes it easy for us to accomplish the mission. \\n\\nThe major instruction that actually led to Israel\\'s final exit from Egypt was the sprinkling of the Passover lamb\\'s blood for protection from death by the Israelites. They did it as they were instructed. Israel\\'s first male children were preserved, while the Egyptians\\' firstborns died, and Israel was forcefully let go. You see, the instruction they followed brought them deliverance while their enemies perished in the Red Sea. Wow, this is a great deliverance! We have learned that following instructions tied to any given task makes it easy to carry out the task. Thank you and bye for now.\"',\n",
       " '\"What is sovereignty?\" Have you ever had someone say, \"You don\\'t question my authority?\" That statement vividly describes sovereignty, which means an unquestionable authority. God alone has this authority because only His authority cannot be questioned in the entire universe. By His authority, things came into existence. Can you see the beautiful sky, the stars, the moon, and the birds that fly in it? All other land creatures, the beaches, and rivers, God made them all. But before creation, the template for these beautiful things to exist was first made, which is the heaven and the earth. Then God made the light to drive away the darkness that covered the earth. That was God\\'s first creation for day one. You can see the sky; God made it on the second day. Have you seen a plane land on the ground on which we march and beautiful beaches and the large waters we have around? He made them on the third day. What about the sun that shines in the day, the moon, and the stars at night? He made them on the fourth day. The fishes we eat today, the birds that fly in the sky, were all made on the fifth day. On the sixth day, you and I and other living animals were made. On the seventh day, God rested. Today, we have beautiful gardens around us where we can relax and sometimes catch some fun with the sight of the beautiful walk of nature that looked like what God made. The Garden of Eden, He made the garden and beautified it with beautiful trees and plants. God made four beautiful rivers to flow in the garden to water the plants. They are River Petition, Geon, Tigris, and Euphrates. And God specifically and especially created man and woman to take care of all He has made in the garden. Today, we have learned that one, we have to care for God\\'s creatures. Today, some of us have pets at home that we care for. Two, God intended a day off for humans. He exemplified it when He rested after creation on the seventh day. Three, God made all things from His spoken words except man. Four, we are to watch over our actions because we will stand alone to defend any action we carry out. Thank you, and bye for now.',\n",
       " \"In the previous class, we learned about how God helped Moses successfully remove the children of Israel from Egypt and saved them from Pharaoh and his chariots. Moses, with the help of Aaron, delivered his people from the oppression of Pharaoh and his people. In this class, we will explore some of the qualities that make Moses a great leader. There are certain qualities that one must possess to lead any group successfully, such as vision, flexibility, inspiration, and empathy. In Moses' case, there are visible qualities that he possessed. Firstly, faithfulness - Moses believed in God and kept his faith even in the face of danger. Secondly, intercessor - Moses pleaded for the people with God when they showed unfaithfulness. Thirdly, endurance - Moses showed great endurance, even when people complained against him for bringing them to suffer in the wilderness. Fourthly, patriotism - Moses completely loved Israel, and this was evident when he killed an Egyptian in support of an Israelite. I also believe that God called him because of his love for Israel. Lastly, courage - despite the initial fear of facing Pharaoh, Moses showed great courage throughout the journey. We hope that you have been inspired by what we have learned about Moses as a leader.

You will also do well if you can gladly accept your Godly training. This is exactly where Eli failed as a parent. He did not take serious disciplinary actions against his children for their evil deeds, despite his position as a judge over Israel for 40 years. His children, Hophni and Phinehas, were engaged in many crimes. They did not take the sacrifices meant for God seriously. Instead, they took part of the raw meat for sacrifices forcefully from the people, instead of allowing it to go through the boiling process before taking it. They even slept with the women who were serving in the temple. What a shame for their evil deeds! God punished the household of Eli. His two sons died in the battle between Israel and the Philistines. As a result of the fight, the Philistines took away the Ark of the Covenant. When Eli heard it, he fell from his chair, broke his neck, and died at the age of 98. \\n\\nFinian\\'s wife went into labor prematurely when she heard what happened to the ark and her father-in-law.

Have you ever seen a lawyer collecting a bribe to defend evil? This was exactly the practice of Samuel\\'s sons as judges in Israel. What a disappointment! \\n\\nWe have learned from the story that: \\n1. We should not fail in our parenting to our children to avoid being punished for our children\\'s sins. \\n2. When we do well as children, our parents will eventually live happily in their old age. \\n3. As children, we must learn to consciously follow the right path to make our parents proud and not be punished because of us. \\n\\nThank you and bye for now.',\n",

In two different ways, instructions were given to the Hebrew boys named Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. In number three of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20, God instructed that we should not bow down to any graven image. However, the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, made a statue which was set up on Dura Plain in the province of Babylon. He ordered that at the sound of the flutes and trumpet, everyone should bow down in dedication to it. Anyone who failed to bow would be thrown into the fire. This was a threat and a test of faith to the Hebrew children, but they chose to obey God and refused to bow to the statue at the king\\'s command. The message got to Nebuchadnezzar that the boys refused, and he ordered them to come for questioning on why they should disregard his authority. But they insisted on obeying God by not bowing to the image. The punishment for this was that they were thrown into the furnace fire. Moreover, the fire was kindled seven times hotter to the extent that it caught up with the men that threw them in the fire and they were burned. God saw their obedience to Him and showed up in the fire in the form of the Son of God. They were miraculously helped and delivered. Nebuchadnezzar saw how God had helped the three boys and he had regard for the true and living God. He commanded everyone in Babylon to begin to serve the God of the Hebrew boys, and they were promoted for their act of obedience to God. The lesson is that sometimes in life, we go through suffering for standing for the truth. We should not give up, as God is aware and will surely come to our rescue. Thank you and bye for now.\"',\n",

However, as soon as he became king, he decided to change all of those bad things happening in the society. \\n\\nJust like how bad things happened before Josiah became king, bad things are beginning to happen in our churches today. Many pastors and even Christians are caught doing a lot of bad things. A lot of pastors behave like they love God and they are not bad people, but they are only pretending and are not interested in being good just like how God wants them to be. God has told us in the Bible that He wants us to be like Him everywhere we go, in church, at school, and where people cannot see us. But these pastors will only do what God wants us to do where people are, and then when nobody is there, they do bad things. \\n\\nNow, because of the bad things people call themselves Christians do, there is no difference between Christians and people who are not Christians. When Josiah became king, he made sure everything changed. Some of the things Josiah did to change the ways of his people, we can use as lessons now. Josiah didn't care that all the kings before him were bad. He decided he was going to do only the right things. Also, even though he was very young, he asked God for wisdom and he did better than everyone before him. \\n\\nHalf-time leaders should learn to be like Josiah so they can do the work of God properly. In conclusion, the good things Josiah did made people ask God to be their father and even began to understand that it is God they need in their lives and nobody else.

David had faith that God would heal his brother and this gave him hope. After praying, David felt more at peace and less sad. Faith in God is about trusting in Him even before the desired outcome is achieved. For example, if you need new clothes or books, you can pray to God and believe that He will provide them for you. This is what is meant by faith. In conclusion, faith can be defined as the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen, as stated in Hebrews 11:1-2.

Even when you don't feel like God loves you, He wants you to know that He always cares for you. \\n\\nIn the Bible, there were three young men named Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego who decided to serve God with all their hearts. When their king, King Nebuchadnezzar, created a foreign idol and said everyone must bow down to it, they refused to disobey God and bow down. Even though the king loved these three men and had made them part of his officials, he was offended and promised to deal with them by throwing them into a fire. He even made the fire three times hotter so they could burn to ashes. \\n\\nThe three men were not scared or angry. They had faith in God and the courage that God would take care of them. Immediately, the king threw them into the fire, and God sent His Holy Spirit to go and protect them. Everybody, including the king, was surprised. There were only three men thrown into the fire, so how come four men were now seen inside the fire? The fire didn't burn the boys, and the king was very surprised because of this. The king asked everyone in Babylon to serve God. \\n\\nIn conclusion, sometimes God can send you through tough times, but He is always with you.

In case of accidents, the FRSC offers assistance to the victims. Overall, the FRSC has helped in the way Nigerian roads are used and in the reduction of road accidents.',\n",
       " \"Have you seen a traffic light before? If you have, you know that cars are supposed to move when the lights turn green, not red. Rules were created for the road so that everyone using them would be safe and there would be order and control. Even though the government has its responsibility, you as an individual must always obey traffic laws. Even when you see others breaking the rules, you must ensure that you do not join them in breaking the rules. Don't forget that others are using the road with you, so you must always think about their safety too. Once enforcement agencies like the Federal Road Safety Commission tell you to do things within your right, don't be rude to them or drive and walk away. They are there for your safety, so make sure you respect and obey them, even if you are in a hurry. You are not supposed to destroy road signs. These signs are very important and they guide people. Destroying them would mean you are breaking your responsibilities as a law-abiding citizen. In conclusion, if you notice that there is so much traffic and congestion, you can also help in controlling the traffic. For people selling, they should learn not to sell by the roadside so cars can pass by freely. See you in my next class, guys!\",\n",
       " \"Do you have friends who live on the same street or in the same neighborhood as you? I'm sure you do. Having friends to talk to and have fun with is very important for humans. It would be difficult not to have any friends, unless you live in a remote area all by yourself. If you don't have people whom you call your friends, life can be challenging because you would always have to do everything by yourself with no one to talk to. There are many types of friendships and relationships you can have with people around you. One type is between a man and a woman, often leading to marriage and building a family. Another type is between people of the same gender, which is a very common type of relationship. Additionally, if a group of people who are in the same class or age range are friends, it is called a peer relationship. When the government meets the needs of the people, they form a relationship with them, especially during the election period. This relationship is called the government-citizen relationship. In conclusion, all we have discussed are types of interpersonal relationships. Interpersonal relationships are the interactions that happen between two or more people in a society.\",\n",

Imagine if you and your neighbors didn't talk to each other - you would feel uncomfortable and there would be no harmony. Building relationships with people in your community can bring peace and unity. Through these relationships, people learn to live with each other. Additionally, once you have a good relationship with people in your society, there would be no need for chaos or fights because laws and order would be maintained. It would also be easy to notice someone who isn't a member of the society claiming to be one. Having interpersonal relationships with people around you can bring an environment of love and peace. Everyone who thinks of that society would always have good thoughts about them. Finally, no one can live alone. At some point, you will need the help of your neighbors or people around you. If you don't build a good relationship with them, it will be difficult for them to help you and for you to help them. Overall, building relationships with people in your community is important for a harmonious and peaceful society.\",\n",

They believe that they are one big family. Most of them are farmers. Not only do they produce the same products on their farms, but they also help each other. They clear their farmlands together and look out for their neighbors' farms so that animals won't feed on their crops. Most times, the fathers are the farmers, and the wives help them on the farm, especially with harvesting products. Another way by which the communal society is similar is that they allow and want their children to marry amongst themselves. They will share the same gods, go to the same shrine, and have the same yearly festivals. Not only that, but they also work together to make their community good. They dig wells that are needed, clean the marketplace, and the roads. In conclusion, the communal society doesn't contest elections as it happens in a city. Instead, everyone is divided into groups depending on their ages, and they select their leaders based on what the people want. If anyone is found guilty of a crime, the person would be punished accordingly. Thanks for coming to class. See you in my next class, guys!\",\n",

Even in communal societies where they act like one big happy family, they also face struggles and disagreements. However, they don't let it escalate or cause problems among them. Instead, they discuss the issue causing the disagreement and the leader sets to resolving it. Sometimes, they may even call an outsider who isn't related to any of the parties involved to settle any complaints. If someone's property was destroyed, the leaders can decide to replace it to restore peace. Additionally, they may set up a team to act as a mediator to settle issues and to discourage people from destroying lives and property, no matter how angry they are. The most important part about settling conflicts in communal societies is that they do so peacefully. Thank you for attending my class, guys.\",\n",
       " 'When communities that are located far from the city live together and behave like a family, some people may not understand why they do it. However, having a communal relationship is important because it prevents disagreements among them. If there is a disagreement, they can call a meeting to help settle any differences. Additionally, their communal relationship makes them closer than before. Members of different communities treat each other with respect and come together to celebrate important activities such as festivals, choosing a leader, and other special ceremonies. Furthermore, there is no form of violence happening in these communities. All of them are similar to each other, so they live in peace and harmony. They also show respect to their leaders and follow all the rules and laws laid down for them.

However, computers have a physical body that we can interact with, which we can see, touch, feel, move, and where physical injury, damage, wear and tear can come to computers. This body is what is known as the computer's hardware. My guess is that you're probably using a computer device to access this lesson right now. How do I know? Well, there is no way you could have done this without physical contact with your computer device, whether it's a desktop computer, laptop computer, or even a smartphone. To do this, you must have pressed the button to turn on your device, looked into a screen, or listened to the speaker that produces sounds. These physical components of your computer that you can touch, like the keyboard, mouse, monitor, storage disk, touchscreen, and system unit, are what is referred to as hardware because they are tangible and mobile. They can be classified based on their functions into five components, which are input components used to instruct the computer, like the mouse, keyboard, scanner, camera, and so on, output components that bring out desired results from the instructions we have given the computer, like the speaker that produces sound, monitor that displays, printer, and the projector system. The system unit is responsible for the circuitry and logical functions, the processing unit is responsible for converting raw ideas to required information, and the storage device is for keeping our files and documents in a safe form until needed. So, in today's lesson, we have seen what computer hardware is. I believe you enjoyed today's class. See you in the next lesson. Thank you!\",\n",

Since computers cannot think on their own, we interact with them by giving instructions. We use input devices to do this. Let's take a look at some of the input devices we have. The keyboard is the most common type of input device with 104 keys used to type in alphabets, numbers, and functions. The mouse interacts with the computer through a process known as point and click to position the cursor, move objects, and open applications. The scanner is used to transfer images or texts into a computer from a book. The joystick is often used to control video games. Microphones are used to record voice and sounds into a computer and to send voice chats. The pen is used to point, write, or draw on a computer screen, and many others like the webcam, and so on.

Do you know which computer device I often use for shortcuts? The keyboard! Let me tell you about my friend Teddy. Teddy got a job as a typist at a newspaper company because he had mastered typing skills and spent many hours practicing. Teddy can now type very fast, which convinced him to take the job. But unknowingly to him, there was something else he was yet to know. What could that be? I'll tell you. Teddy resumed work and found out on the first day that he could not use shortcuts. Every other typist at work completed the required number of pages, but Teddy barely reached half. Thanks to Bola, who saw how worrisome Teddy was, she decided to help him master keyboard shortcuts to help him type faster and accurately. Now that we have learned in this lesson that we can use keyboard shortcuts to work faster and accurately on the computer, I know you must be eager to know what these shortcuts are.

In today's lesson, we will be learning about various keyboard shortcuts and how to use them. Let's get started! \\n\\nTo find an item quickly, instead of searching, we use Ctrl+F. If you want to jump over and move faster to an item, we use Ctrl+G. To open a document that already exists, we use Ctrl+O. To open a new document, we use Ctrl+N. To type in italics, we use Ctrl+I. To align objects to the center of the document, we use Ctrl+E. To align objects to the right, we use Ctrl+R. To align objects to the left, we use Ctrl+L. Finally, for justification, we use Ctrl+J. \\n\\nThe three most common shortcuts are Ctrl+C for copy, Ctrl+X for cut, and Ctrl+V for paste. These cut, copy, and paste shortcuts are used to move objects and insert items in a space. To make items bold, we use Ctrl+K. To duplicate an item, we use Ctrl+B. To underline, we use Ctrl+U. To increase the indent of a line, we use Ctrl+T. To select all items in a file, we use Ctrl+A. \\n\\nIf you make mistakes while typing, don't worry! Just use Ctrl+Z to undo or Ctrl+Y to redo what you've done and continue working. Ctrl+P is used to print once work is done, and finally, Ctrl+S is used to save both during and after work is done to avoid losing files and working all over again. \\n\\nSo, in today's class, we have learned various shortcuts that make typing faster, time-saving, and accurate.

Anytime I need my work, I can locate it. Now, how do you think computers do this? They are able to keep whatever instructions, data, or information on them without getting lost, even when the computer is not in use. They make use of storage devices. Storage devices are devices used to store instructions and data when they are not in use by the system unit.

You must have seen one before. It looks very much like the discs we often buy to watch videos or movies. It is a smaller optical disk that can store about 450 times the data on a floppy disk. So, what is a floppy disk? It is a flexible platter coated with a material that allows data to be recorded magnetically on the platter's surface. Thirdly, there are data cabbages. They are also storage devices that provide fast access to the information they contain and are removable. Others are smart cards, which are about the size of a credit card with a thin microprocessor capable of storing data. Lastly, tape cartridges are what we used to call cassettes.

Similarly, we humans have a head that controls the activities of our body parts. Just like a country has a federal government that controls all the affairs of the nation, a computer has a central processing unit (CPU) that controls all the activities of all the different parts of the computer. So, what is the CPU? The CPU is the hardware part of a computer that carries out all the instructions of a computer program by performing basic arithmetic or logical and input or output operations of the system. We can simply say that the CPU is the brain of the computer where most operations, calculations, and processes take place. However, if a computer has a brain, does it mean it can think on its own? No, it is only able to carry out the instructions given to it. Hope you enjoyed this lesson. See you in the next one. Bye!',\n",

The first component is the Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU), which performs arithmetic and logical operations. It is responsible for carrying out arithmetic operations on integers and decimal numbers. The second component is the Control Unit, which extracts instructions from the computer memory, decodes and executes them, and transfers them to the ALU when necessary.

Have you ever wondered how a computer is able to distinguish between a text document, music, an application, or a video? How does a computer store and separate data and information in memory? If you have been to a library before, you will see how the librarian uses shelves to separate different documents containing different information and labels them so that when someone comes in to read, they can easily find the right shelf and pick a book of interest. Similarly, files are the format computers use to hold data, information, and text so that it can be separated, saved, and reused when needed.

Every other part of the computer system depends on the monitor to function correctly. If the monitor is dirty and unable to function correctly, the whole computer system will be weak and helpless. In this lesson, we will be learning practical steps on how to clean a monitor. \\n\\nSo, what are the things we need to clean a monitor? We need a clean dry cloth, mild soap solution, vacuum cleaner, window cleaner, and dust prevention cover. \\n\\nStep 1: If the monitor is in use, unplug the power supply cord and graphics cable from the back of the monitor and allow it to cool for at least 20 minutes. \\n\\nStep 2: Use a vacuum to clean the grooves, holes, and slots on the top surface of the monitor where heavy dust or other debris may have settled. Then, blow compressed air in short puffs at an angle to the monitor surface. The goal is to remove dust and dirt without letting anything fall into the ventilation holes. \\n\\nStep 3: Lightly dampen a cloth with a mild soap solution and wipe down the outside plastic portions of the monitor. \\n\\nStep 4: Clean the monitor cables and power cord while they are disconnected. Lightly dampen a cloth with the mild soap solution and gently pull the cables and cords through the cloth. \\n\\nStep 5: Spray a window cleaner onto a lint-free cloth and wipe the screen clean. \\n\\nStep 6: Once cleaning is done, use a computer dust cover to protect the monitor. \\n\\nOur monitor is now looking like brand new again. This cleaning process can be done at least once a week. I'll see you in the next class. Join me!\",\n",

These holes can easily accumulate dust, debris, and liquids, which can cause the keyboard to malfunction or get damaged quickly. In this lesson, we will learn practical steps on how to clean a keyboard. \\n\\nTo clean a keyboard, you will need a clean dry cloth, a mild soap solution, a vacuum cleaner, isopropyl alcohol, and a good keyboard cover. Here are the steps to follow:\\n\\n1. Remove the cables from the back of the computer case.\\n2. Use a vacuum cleaner to remove debris between the keys. If you don't have a vacuum, turn the keyboard upside down and gently tap on the back to dislodge debris.\\n3. Aim between the keys and blow compressed air to remove remaining dust and debris. Use short puffs of air applied at about a 30 to 45 degree angle to the keyboard surface. Alternate between blowing the keys and tapping the keyboard upside down to dislodge particles until it is clean.\\n4. Lightly dampen the cloth with a mild soap solution and wipe down the outside of the keyboard. Do not spray soap solution directly into the keyboard.\\n5. Dip a swab in isopropyl alcohol and clean between, around, and on top of the keys. Change the swabs as they become dirty.\\n6. Wipe the keyboard cord with a cloth lightly dampened with a mild soap solution. Gently pull the cord through the cloth and dry it with a dry cloth.\\n7. Use a good keyboard cover in a dusty or dirty manufacturing environment.\\n\\nBy following these steps, your keyboard will look like a brand new one again.

You\\'re probably familiar with nouns - they are naming words for people, animals, places, or things. For example, Andy, Richard, David, Rebecca, and Tracy are all examples of nouns for people. Parrots, cats, dogs, monkeys, and other animals are examples of nouns for animals. Nigeria, Canada, Lagos, Benin, and Akure are examples of nouns for places. And a ruler, ball, umbrella, and book are examples of nouns for things. In the next lesson, we\\'ll dive deeper into the different types of nouns. See you then!\"',\n",

As the head of an association, it is important to attend meetings where certain issues are discussed and give members feedback on the events and information gathered. This is what we call a report. The report should be written sequentially, for example, junior police officers give reports to their bosses, junior workers in the office give reports to their superiors, and even commercial drivers give reports to the owners daily. If all senior prefects of a school in a town or local government hold a meeting where issues are discussed to improve academic performance, a piece of composition or information will be required to be given to the head. This is also a report. We also have reports of sports events and police officers who give reports of meetings. Minutes of a meeting are also a form of report. Today we have learned that a report is an account of an event or action that has taken place in the past. It is a piece of composition that presents actual information.

The first step is to write a catchy and informative title in all capital letters with initial letters of content words also capitalized. The second step is to write an introductory paragraph that includes the play, date, time, characters, and reason for the event. Next, write the body of the report, developing ideas and issues paragraph by paragraph. After that, proceed to the conclusion where you sum up and form a judgment about the issue. The conclusion may be in the form of advice or how to tackle a problem. The last step is to write the full name and designation of the writer, usually at the right back side of the event.

For example, \"day\" has one syllable, \"teacher\" has two syllables, and \"pacify\" has three syllables. Words like \"dead,\" \"teacher,\" and \"pacify\" have patterns of word stress. The word \"come\" is monosyllabic, while \"mother\" is disyllabic or bisyllabic. \"Minimum\" is a polysyllabic word. When you pronounce a word with more than one syllable, the stress pattern determines where you emphasize. It\\'s important to study the stress pattern of each group to avoid emphasizing the wrong syllables.

Recently, a friend of mine reported that the President of Nigeria announced an increase in fuel prices. This is an example of reported speech. Journalists often use reported speech when they write news articles or magazines. When making speeches or reporting speeches, it's important to follow certain rules for changing direct speech to indirect speech. These rules include modifying tense, changing pronouns and demonstratives, modifying adverbials, and changing questions. In this lesson, we have learned seven criteria for changing direct speech to indirect speech, and we will continue to learn more in our next lesson.\",\n",

We should follow the rules when reporting what someone has said. The first rule is to report what someone has said in direct speech. However, when changing a sentence from direct speech to reported speech, certain aspects of the direct speech have to be modified. This modification involves changing the time, place, and persons referred to in the original statement, as well as the use of certain languages. Let us consider the following examples: \"Kimi told me, \\'I will visit you tomorrow\\'\" and \"Basha asked them, \\'Will you buy these books?\\'\" These sentences may be changed to reported speech as follows: \"Kimi told me that she would visit me tomorrow or the following day\" or \"Basha asked them whether or if they would buy those books.\" In reported speech, certain aspects may change, such as the form of tenses, verbs, adverbial references of time, place references, and certain pronouns.

Let\\'s consider this illustration: Mr. Ajayi told me, \"I am hungry.\" She writes to us, \"Your results have been released.\" They have agreed with me, \"We shall go there tomorrow.\" \\n\\nNow, let us consider the changes of pronoun from direct speech to reported speech. Mr. Ajayi told me that he was hungry. She writes to us that our results have been released. They agreed with me that they should go there.

You know that this, that, these, and those always indicate the location of the nouns. Do you know that this, that, these, and those are called demonstratives? If the demonstratives \"this\" and \"these\" occur in a direct statement, then they will change in reported speech. \"This\" changes to \"that\" and \"these\" changes to \"those,\" even if they occur as determiners or to modify sentences. Consider the examples below: \"This day\" changes to \"that day,\" \"this week\" changes to \"that week,\" \"these months\" changes to \"those months,\" and \"these years\" changes to \"those years.\" In direct speech, Abigail emphasized, \"This is wrong.\" In a prophecy, a day declared, \"The students are lost these days.\" In reported speech, Abigail emphasized that \"that\" was wrong. The professor declared that the students were lazy \"those days.\" They demonstrated this and these in indirect speeches, which change to \"that\" and \"those\" in reported speech.

Reported speech - Sade inquired whether or if that man was her brother. Reported speech - The policeman questioned what my name was. We see from the examples above that the questions \"Have you come?\", \"Was the man my brother?\", or \"What is your name?\" in direct speech can change to a question that begins with \"whether\" in reported speech.

There are major ways in which \\'must\\' can be used, and each of them requires different forms in reported speech. In this sense, the adverbials we used in direct speech will determine the changes of the verb form in reported speech. Consider this illustration: In direct speech, Michael said, \\'I must leave this place now.\\' In direct speech, my wife informed me, \\'I must visit the airport tomorrow.\\' In direct speech, the principal commanded, \\'Every student must respect their teachers.\\' In reported speech, Michael had made up his mind that he had to leave that place. Then, in reported speech, my wife informed me that she would have to visit the airport the next day. In reported speech, the principal commanded that every student must respect their teachers. In the first sentence, \\'must\\' changes to \\'had to\\' because it indicates past in reported speech. In the second sentence, \\'must\\' changes to \\'would have to\\' because it indicates the future in reported speech. In the third sentence, \\'must\\' remains unchanged in reported speech because it indicates compulsion.

In the case of adverbials, the following are ways of changing them from direct speech to reported speech: \"today\" changes to \"that day,\" \"yesterday\" changes to \"the previous day,\" \"tomorrow\" changes to \"the following day\" or \"the next day,\" \"last night\" changes to \"the previous night,\" \"next week\" changes to \"the following week,\" \"here\" changes to \"there,\" and \"now\" changes to \"then.\" It is important to learn how they can be changed from direct speech to reported speech. For example, in direct speech, a buyer said, \"I came to your house yesterday.\" In reported speech, it would be \"The buyer said that he came to the house the previous day.\" Another example is when my fiance promised me, \"I will visit you this week.\" In reported speech, it would be \"My fiance promised me that he would visit me the following week.\" Today\\'s lesson taught us that adverbials change when we\\'re writing or changing from direct speech to reported speech.

We always feed myself. \\'You their self\\' does not exist as a reflexive pronoun. Say \\'themselves\\' instead. A reflexive pronoun may be emphatic or intensive. If the emphasis is put on the subject of the sentence, consider this example too: He himself told me. The money was given to me by Tallu himself. The story itself is interesting. Also, a reflexive pronoun can be emphasized by introducing the word \\'by\\'. Consider this example too: The students spoke by themselves. You sweep the floor by yourself. How about that?

       " 'If I ask \"What is your name?\" or \"Where are you coming from?\", I am asking a question. Similarly, if I ask \"Who said this?\", I am also asking a question. Any word that is used to ask a question is called an interrogative pronoun. Some examples of interrogative pronouns are \"what\", \"which\", \"who\", \"whom\", etc. When we use these words to ask a question, they give us a noun as an answer. For example, if I ask \"Whom do you wish to work with, Mr. Zulu?\", the answer would be a noun. According to modern linguistics, no preposition is allowed to answer an interrogative pronoun. Instead, it should occur at the end of the sentence. For instance, we should say \"Which city have you been transferred to?\" instead of \"To which city have you been transferred?\". It\\'s important to remember that an interrogative pronoun always begins a sentence and not in the middle of a sentence.

Consider this example: \\'Two of the questions are difficult.\\' Number two is second. Your suggestion will be supported. Both cardinals and ordinals can be pre-modified by the article. Now consider the example: \\'The three stories I told you are interesting. The first of the matters gives me great concern.\\' Ordinals should be used with singular verbs. Consider this example: \\'The third on my list has a crucial meaning to me. The first of them is mine.\\' It is incorrect to say \\'The third on my list have a crucial meaning now\\' or \\'First of them are.\\' Except for \\'one,\\' all other cardinals should be used with plural verbs. Consider the following examples: \\'Five of the students fail the course. The two of the questions are twisted.\\' Don\\'t say \\'Five of the student fails the course\\' or \\'The two of the student is.\\' Use \\'are.\\' \\'One\\' should be followed by a singular verb. For example, \\'One of those thugs has died,\\' not \\'One of those dogs have died.\\' That was interesting!

       " 'Have you heard of indefinite pronouns like anybody, somebody, nobody, someone, anything, something, nothing, many, some, most, and so on? Can you use them in sentences? These words are called indefinite pronouns. \"No one\" can be written separately but should not be hyphenated. For example, \"No one is here,\" not \"No-one is here\" without any hyphen. Okay, now let\\'s look at examples of each type. Sometimes, \"whoever,\" \"whichever,\" and \"one\" must be followed by a singular verb. \"Anybody\" can go there. \"Someone\" has done it. \"Nobody\" comes to the meeting. \"Whoever\" or \"whichever\" wants to see me should wait. It is wrong to say \"someone have\" or \"nobody calm\" or \"whoever wants it\" is wrong. \"Anyone,\" \"anybody,\" \"somebody,\" or \"someone\" and \"nobody\" or \"no one\" are all used in the same sense. For example, \"Somebody\" or \"someone\" calls me. \"Nobody\" or \"no one\" was there. \"Many,\" \"some,\" \"most,\" and other hand are used with plural verbs because they\\'re all plural indefinite pronouns. Consider this example: \"Some of you are imbecile.\" \"Most of the students remain calm.\" \"Many of us have become well-known musicians.\" It is wrong to say \"some of you is\" or \"most remains\" or \"mini.\" That would be wrong. So, if any types of indefinite pronoun functions as objects, they must be preceded by negative verbs, while no types of indefinite pronouns must be preceded by positive verbs. Let\\'s consider another example: \"I don\\'t want anybody here. I want nobody here.\" It is incorrect to say \"I don\\'t want nobody here.\" The reason is that \"nobody\" is a negative indefinite pronoun, so it does not require another negative verb. That\\'s it. In this lesson, we have learned that an indefinite pronoun always shows a part of the whole and does not make a specific reference to any person or thing, as occurred in a personal pronoun.

If your answer is yes, there are still some points you can learn.\\n\\nLet's take a look at the format of minutes for a meeting. For example, the minutes of the seventh regular meeting of the Jodas Landlord Association held in the city of Jose. You need to write the date, time, and the names of the members who were present. You also need to list the names of the members who were absent and the reasons for their absence, whether it was with or without an apology.\\n\\nNext, you need to indicate who moved the motion for the adoption of the agenda of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting usually gives the opening remarks and welcomes new members. You need to mention everything that the chairman said.\\n\\nAfter that, you can proceed to the adoption of the minutes of the previous meeting. You need to mention who moved the motion and whether it was adopted or not. Then, you need to list out the matters arising from the previous meeting, including any reports from the committee.\\n\\nYou also need to mention whether the report was accepted or not and any other points that were discussed. If there are any new matters arising, you need to list them out too.\\n\\nFinally, you need to indicate who moved the motion for the adjournment of the meeting and at what time the meeting was adjourned. You also need to leave space for the chairman and secretary to sign.\\n\\nThis is the real format of minutes for a meeting. It may seem overwhelming at first, but with practice, you'll be able to write minutes with ease.\",\n",
       " 'Are you aware that when you speak, your voice naturally goes up and down? This can happen in the middle or at the end of a word. When your voice goes up, it\\'s called a rising tone, and when it goes down, it\\'s called a falling tone. Both rising and falling tones are part of what we call intonation. In essence, intonation refers to the rise and fall of the tone of your voice while speaking. Let\\'s practice identifying different types of intonation. I\\'ll give you a sentence, and you tell me what type of intonation is used. For example, \"The man is here.\" What tone is used there? Now try this one: \"Show me the way.\" Can you tell what tone is used there? When you read the sentences above, did my voice go up or down? Compare it with this one: \"Will you do it for me?\" Did my voice go up or down? In the first sentence, my voice went down, and in the second sentence, it went up. How about you? When you read it, how was the tone of your voice? Remember, in this lesson, we\\'ve learned that intonation is a combination of the rise and fall of the tone of your voice. It\\'s the way the pitch of your voice goes up and down while you speak. We\\'ll learn more about intonation in our next class.',\n",
       " 'Did you know that intonation is not randomly applied when we speak? There are specific ways to use intonation. For example, a falling tone occurs when the pitch of your voice falls at the end of a sentence. This is the most common intonation pattern in English and is commonly heard in statements, commands, wh-questions, information questions, confirmatory question tags, and exclamations. For instance, in a statement, the application of the falling tone would be \"The man is here.\" When using a full tone, it is applied to sentences like \"She doesn\\'t live here\" and \"See you soon.\" Full tone is also used in commands like \"Sit down here\" and \"Throw it away, photo.\" When asking wh-questions, full tone is applied to sentences like \"Where do you work?\" and \"Whose book is that?\" On the other hand, rising intonation invites the speaker to continue talking and is normally used with yes or no questions. The pitch goes up in this case. For example, \"Have you finished it?\" and \"May I come in?\" are yes or no questions that use rising intonation. Tag questions like \"They said it, didn\\'t they?\" and \"It\\'s not me, is it?\" also use rising intonation. In this lesson, we have learned about intonation and the different tones that can be applied. We can use full tone for wh-questions and rising tone to list items and ask questions.

       " 'Have you noticed that just as different parts make up our body and different branches make up a tree, different people make up a group? Similarly, different parts of speech come together to form a phrasal verb. The verb or word that makes up a phrasal verb can be a preposition, adverb, or verb. These three components combine to form phrasal verbs, which do not have an ordinary meaning. For example, the word \"blown\" is a combination of the verb \"blow\" and a preposition \"in\" to make a phrasal verb \"blow in\". Apart from the formation of the phrasal verb, it does not have a literal meaning but a figurative one. In the light of the above, the word \"blowing\" means to arrive or enter a place abruptly, not to blow. Similarly, the word \"taken\" means to deceive or to be pregnant, not to take something inside. In this lesson, we have learned that a phrasal verb is simply a combination of a preposition or an adverb and a lexical verb. Mathematically, a lexical verb plus preposition or adverb is equal to a phrasal verb. Therefore, the phrasal verb serves as an idiomatic expression, and its meaning is non-literal. We shall learn more in our next lesson.',\n",
       " 'The text below contains examples of different things. For instance, a tree has different parts such as the trunk, branches, and leaves.

Let\\'s take a look at a few. \\n\\n- \"Back down\" means to admit that someone is wrong. \\n- \"Back out\" means to fail to fulfill a promise. \\n- \"Backup\" means to support. \\n- \"Bite back\" means to refrain from expressing something, like a secret. \\n- \"Blue out\" means to extinguish, like a flame. \\n- \"Give up\" means to abandon an attempt to do something. \\n- \"Give out\" means to come to an end or be exhausted. \\n\\nThere are many more examples and meanings to explore. For example, \"given\" means to allow oneself to be defeated or overcome by someone or something, while \"giveaway\" means to give something free of charge. \"Take down\" means to write something down, while \"take off\" means to remove something. \"Taken\" means to deceive, while \"take away\" means to lessen or weaken something. \"Buy off\" means to bribe someone, while \"call off\" means to cancel something. Finally, \"come through\" means to become or do what is expected in a very nice way. \\n\\nIn this lesson, we have learned that phrasal verbs have different meanings depending on the combination of prepositions, adverbs, or verbs used.

For instance, if we say \\'pre-degree\\', we are referring to something that comes before a degree. Did you know that two or more words can come together to form meaningful words? This is where prefixes come in. In order for a prefix to make sense, it must have a root word. For example, \\'im\\' plus \\'possible\\' means \\'impossible\\', \\'ill\\' plus \\'legal\\' means \\'illegal\\', and \\'mouth\\' plus \\'practice\\' means \\'malpractice\\'. A prefix is a syllable or word placed before a root word to form a new and meaningful word. For instance, we have the root words \\'cycle\\' and \\'purpose\\'. When we add the prefixes \\'by\\' or \\'multi\\' to them, we get new words such as \\'bicycle\\' and \\'multipurpose\\'.

Grammarians recognize the sentence as a very important unit of language, and the word that plays a vital role in the meaning of the sentence is the verb. It is safe to say that the verb is like the engine in a car. The verb explains vividly what a subject or subjects do in a well-formed sentence. Any well-defined sentence must contain a definite verb in order to have meaning and sense. Let\\'s consider some examples: \"A day to Lagos\" and \"Mr. Ojo beans last night.\" In the examples just given, the expressions 1 and 3 are meaningless and basically senseless because something mandatory, that\\'s the verb, is missing. Those two expressions cannot be defined as a sentence, whereas the expressions in two and four are meaningful and sensible because they contain the action verbs \"goes\" and \"ate\" that explain the subject Ade and Mr. Ojo, respectively. The number 2 and 4 can be defined as a sentence. Seeing the importance of a verb in a sentence, we can say that if we\\'re talking about a verb, we\\'re talking about an action because a verb itself is simply the action word of a sentence. Without it in a sentence, the sentence cannot be meaningful. We will discuss the various classes of verbs in our next lesson.',\n",

Some examples of independent verbs include go, calm, curry, draw, mark, remove, blue, rose, written, driven, put, left, jumped, in, and on. All the examples above convey meaning without the use of other verbs. Consider the verbs in the sentences below: \\'He each rise greedily.\\' \\'The wind blew violently.\\' \\'A panel discussed the matter.\\' The readers or listeners can identify the meaning of each verb in these sentences without the use of any other verb.

       " 'Did you know that to effectively use a cutlass for cutting, you must know how to use it? Similarly, for a teacher to teach well, they must learn how to teach. Likewise, to use main verbs correctly in sentences, you must understand the basics of base in lexical verbs. There are five essential thoughts to consider. Firstly, any lexical base verb must be in the present form. For instance, \"I want to eat,\" \"I am telling you to go there,\" and \"I would have told you to sit down.\" It is incorrect to say \"I want to eating\" or \"I want to eaten\" or \"I want to eat.\" Secondly, the lexical verb that follows any model auxiliary must also be in the present form. For example, \"I will call you.\" It is incorrect to say \"I will calling you.\" Thirdly, a good sentence should contain a verb. For instance, \"May I come in?\" It is incorrect to say \"A good sentence should containing a verb.\" Fourthly, when you put emphasis on base, the words \"do,\" \"does,\" and \"did\" are introduced. For example, \"I do speak English,\" \"Did he sleep yesterday?\" or \"She does read often.\" Finally, these are the rudiments of base in lexical verbs. We will cover the strong rudiments of base in lexical verbs in our next lesson.',\n",
       " 'In a previous lesson, we discussed some of the basics of using base forms in lexical verbs. Today, we will learn about other important aspects, including the use of the words \"do,\" \"does,\" or \"did.\" It\\'s important to note that using these words does not change the base form of the verb, which should remain in the present tense. Therefore, it is grammatically incorrect to say \"I do spoke\" or \"I do speak\" in English. Similarly, \"he did slept\" or \"did sleeping yesterday\" are incorrect. The correct usage is \"did he sleep yesterday?\" \\n\\nIt\\'s also important to remember that certain pronouns and nouns can directly follow a lexical base form. For example, \"they sleep together\" or \"I dance to the rhythm.\" However, it is incorrect to use a singular base form like \"calms pigs\" or \"colds\" after \"too\" or a model auxiliary. Therefore, saying \"I want to eat bread\" or \"my dad will beat today\" or \"the students should read well\" is incorrect. \\n\\nThe fifth rule states that there are exceptions to the rule that a base form should follow \"to.\" In some cases, certain words or phrases can be followed by \"to\" and the infinitive form of the verb. However, it\\'s important to note that the base form that follows \"to\" must be in the present tense. Examples of these exceptions include \"look forward to,\" \"limited to,\" \"devoted to,\" \"end up with,\" \"view to,\" \"admitted to,\" \"confessed to,\" \"accustomed to,\" \"follow up with,\" and \"alternative to.\" \\n\\nBy following these rules, you can ensure that your expressions are grammatically correct.

Auxiliary verbs also depend on other verbs to be meaningful. They serve as helpers for other verbs to convey meaning.

For example, in the sentences \"He is playing football\" and \"They have gone there,\" the auxiliary verbs \\'is\\' and \\'have\\' cannot convey meaning unless they are used with the lexical verbs \\'playing\\' and \\'gone\\'. In some cases, the auxiliary verbs \\'was\\', \\'were\\', and \\'where\\' can stand alone in sentences, but they cannot convey meaning by themselves. For instance, in the sentence \"Michael was a boy,\" \\'was\\' is an auxiliary verb functioning as a main verb, but it alone cannot convey meaning unless it is used in a sentence.

Additionally, did you know that we can form different types of verbs from a single verb? For example, we can form past and past participle forms of a verb from its present form. One type of verb form is a regular verb, which has a base form, past form, and participle form. The past form and participle form of regular verbs end in \\'ed\\'. Some examples of regular verbs include \\'sac\\' which becomes \\'sat\\' in the past and participle forms, \\'mark\\' which becomes \\'marked\\' in the past and participle forms, \\'pick\\' which becomes \\'picked\\' in the past and participle forms, and \\'call\\' which becomes \\'called\\' in the past and participle forms.

However, an irregular verb like \"byte\" can change to \"bit\" in the past form and \"written\" in the participle form. Similarly, the irregular verb \"run\" changes to \"ran\" in the past tense and \"run\" in the past participle, while \"come\" changes to \"came\" in the past tense and then back to \"come\" in the past participle.

The question is, are the past and participle forms used in the same way? Let\\'s examine the following sentences: \"The boy hid himself behind the show\" (past form) and \"Bola has carelessly torn her clothes\" (participle form). In these examples, the verb \"hid\" is used independently, while the verb \"torn\" is preceded by the auxiliary verb \"has.\" It\\'s important to understand that participle forms are used with one or more auxiliary verbs, while past forms are not. Therefore, it is incorrect to say \"The boy has hide himself\" or \"Bola has carelessly tear her clothes.\" These would be grammatically incorrect.

For example, \"I don\\'t like how you always react.\" \"It doesn\\'t matter what people say.\" In intransitive verbs, a man can take the position of a direct object. For example, \"My students love reading.\" \"He likes swimming.\" Did you take notes in this lesson? We have learned that a transitive verb is a category of verb that welcomes a direct object. The important key to note here is that an object tending to follow a transitive verb should be direct. We\\'ll discuss intransitive verbs in our next class.',\n",
       " 'Here\\'s the updated text:\\n\\nCan you say \"I dance\"? Music. The man dies. Death. The girls sleep. Sleep. And they walk. Walk. Why? Because the verbs \"dance,\" \"die,\" \"sleep,\" and \"walk\" cannot take direct objects. We are saying that the verbs in these clauses are non-transitive. If they do not take a direct object, they are intransitive verbs. \\n\\nFor example, \"Bola dances.\" The verb \"dances\" in this clause is intransitive because it does not take an object. Intransitive verbs may occur without taking any word after them. For example, \"The protagonist died.\" \"The children are dancing.\" \\n\\nDid you notice that two verbs are possible as intransitive verbs? Take this example: \"Professor Akija always sits down and stands up.\" \"The boy has come and is gone.\" \\n\\nIntransitive verbs may be followed by immediate adverbials. For example, \"Banji was running fast.\" \"You come early.\" The adverbials that follow the verb in these sentences are not objects. Therefore, \"running\" and \"come\" are intransitive. \\n\\nThat was quite an explanation, right? Today we learned that an intransitive verb is a verb that does not take a direct object. Did you know that some facts about stated verbs relate to intransitive verbs? We\\'ll talk more about that in our next class. Bye!',\n",
       " 'Have you engaged in a debate or argument today? Have you ever shared someone else\\'s opinion or made a persuasive argument in your own life? If so, you have participated in an argument. An argumentative essay is when a writer or speaker is given a topic to either support or oppose, and they provide convincing reasons to support their stance. These essays often have topics with two sides, and the writer is expected to choose one and provide evidence that it has more advantages than the other. For example, \"Teachers are better than doctors\" or \"Private schools are preferable to public schools.\" Sometimes, a debate may require a final opinion using words like \"then\" or \"two.\" For instance, \"Punishments should be introduced in tertiary institutions\" or \"Should parents choose careers for their children?\" The goal of an argumentative essay is to persuade the reader to agree with the writer\\'s point of view. In the next lesson, we will learn more about this type of writing.',\n",
       " 'Foreign, did you know that anything that will be successful in life requires it to be done step by step? That is why, for a speaker or writer to be successful in writing an argumentative essay, the following steps should be taken:\\n\\nStep one: Write a title. If you are asked to either oppose or support the motion of a topic, such as \"Civilian rule is better than military rule,\" you should construct or reconstruct the topic while opposing the motion, as in \"Military rule is better than civilian rule,\" if you\\'re opposing the topic.\\n\\nStep two: Write an introduction. Two crucial things should be done here. First, greet your audience from the most important person to the least. Then, introduce the topic and state clearly which side you agree with.\\n\\nStep three: Write the definition of the concepts. There is a need for a defining paragraph for the motion to be clarified, especially if it is not straightforward before the audience. The definition may favor your side.\\n\\nIn this lesson, we have learned some steps in writing a good argumentative essay, namely the title, the introduction, and the definition of concepts used.

Consider the following steps:\\n\\nStep 1: Introduce the topic and state your position.\\nStep 2: Provide background information and explain key terms.\\nStep 3: Present evidence to support your position.\\nStep 4: Write the body of the argument. The writer or speaker should logically and convincingly present their argument in a well-structured paragraph. Linkers such as \"in addition,\" \"for example,\" \"moreover,\" \"however,\" \"consequently,\" \"nonetheless,\" \"yes,\" or \"on the other hand\" can be used. It is also important to address weak points before approaching stronger points.\\nStep 5: Write a conclusion. The writer or speaker should summarize the points in favor of their position and try to win over the audience.\\nStep 6: Write a thank you. It is necessary to thank the audience after concluding your paragraph.\\nStep 7: Write your full name and designation if necessary. In an inter-class debate, you should also include the name of your class beneath your name at the right-hand side of the screen.\\n\\nIn this lesson, we have learned additional steps to make the body of an argumentative essay interesting.

       " '\"Foreigners work together successfully because they agree. Termites build houses successfully because they agree. Even husbands and wives achieve common goals because they agree. Now, organizations and their staff must all work together in agreement. In grammar, the subject and the verb cannot be successful in isolation. They must agree to work successfully. If the subject does not agree with the verb and the verb does not agree with the subject in the sentence, the sentence is considered grammatically incorrect. For example, in the sentence \\'A day go to school,\\' the subject \\'day\\' does not agree with the verb \\'go\\' because a singular verb must be used with a singular object, not a plural verb. So, the correct sentence is \\'A day goes to school.\\' There are many categories of Concord, but today we will only discuss one: subject-verb agreement. We have learned the concepts of Concord as an aspect of grammar, which means the agreements between the parts of the sentence, especially the agreements between the subjects and the verbs. We shall learn the rules of Concord in our next lesson. Thank you.\"',\n",
       " 'Did you know that before a driver can drive on the road, they have to follow the rules and traffic signs? Any driver who does not know or master the road rules and violates them will be penalized. Similarly, there are rules to follow in grammar, called rules of concord. Any student who violates these rules will be penalized. Consider some of these rules in this lesson:\\n\\n1. A singular subject must be used with a singular verb. For example, \"He has gone abroad,\" \"The man writes every day,\" \"She is a little girl,\" \"It was a tall tree.\"\\n\\n2. A plural subject must be used with a plural verb. The verb here will not carry the final \"s\" if it is the main verb. For example, \"My special thanks are due to all my friends,\" \"They are struggling to escape,\" \"I speak English every day.\"\\n\\n3. If the subject is plural in form but singular in meaning, it will then take a singular verb. For example, \"The news is read by a lady,\" \"Mathematics is my favorite subject,\" \"Measles is a deadly disease,\" \"Politics has been described as a dirty game.\"\\n\\n4. Two subjects compounded by \"and\" to function as plural must be used with a plural verb. For example, \"John and Samuel are my friends,\" \"The boy and the girl were brilliant,\" \"Akija and Antija got admission to the university.\"\\n\\n5. In some cases, a compound subject may function as singular if we are talking about the same thing, and if this occurs, it must be used with a singular verb. For example, \"Rice and beans is good for the body,\" \"Lion and Jewel was written by Wole Soyinka,\" \"Inca Bovas and Company has been popularly known in Ibadan.\"\\n\\nDid you guess it? Today\\'s class has been very revealing. We\\'ve learned a lot about spoken English and some rules that bind the agreements between subjects and verbs in sentences. The next class will reveal more rules. Till then, keep speaking right!',\n",
       " 'In the previous lesson, we discussed the rules of concord, including subject-verb agreement. Let\\'s dive deeper into these rules. The 11th rule states that units of measurement, such as time, length, distance, weight, or capacity, should be used with a singular verb. For example, \"Two liters of petrol is not enough for my car.\" Another example is \"30 kilometers was a long journey,\" or \"200 meters is a long track.\" The 12th rule reminds us that \"one\" or \"each\" is used to single out a particular thing, person, place, or idea from a group, and should be used with a singular verb. For instance, \"One of the novels is interesting,\" \"One of the boys has been injured,\" or \"Each of the books costs 200 naira.\" The 13th rule states that if \"one other\" is followed by the relative pronouns \"that,\" \"who,\" or \"which,\" it must be used with a plural verb before welcoming the singular sentence. For example, \"One of the teachers who fluctuate is in the staff room,\" \"One of the rooms which were damaged has been revealed,\" or \"One of the students that have not paid their fees has been favored.\" The 14th rule states that \"number of\" preceded by the article \"a\" implies many and should be used with a plural verb. For example, \"A number of people have died in the accident,\" \"A number of graduates nowadays are half-baked,\" or \"A number of staff disagreed on the issue.\" Finally, the 15th rule states that \"number of\" preceded by the article \"the\" implies the total sum, which refers to a singular subject and should be used with a singular verb. For example, \"The number of death rates this year has drastically reduced,\" \"The number of students in our school is many,\" or \"The number of work was done.\" It\\'s been an awesome class, and we\\'ll learn more in our next session.',\n",
       " 'In the previous lesson, we discussed some of the more complex rules of English grammar. It\\'s important to note that misapplication of these rules can result in grammatical errors, so it\\'s important to make an effort to avoid them. Let\\'s take a look at some more rules to guide us.\\n\\nThe 16th rule states that a collective noun can take a singular verb if the speaker or writer means a group of the same class. For example, \"The committee has worked tirelessly for the uplift of their association,\" \"The team is ready to beat its opponent,\" and \"The choir was invited to a wedding ceremony.\" In these sentences, the committee, team, and choir are all groups of the same class, which is why they are used with singular verbs.\\n\\nIn contrast, the 17th rule states that if the speaker or writer means a group of different classes, then the collective noun must be used with a plural verb. For example, \"The committee have worked tirelessly to uplift their association,\" \"The team are ready to beat their opponents,\" and \"The choir were invited to the wedding ceremony.\" In these cases, the committee, team, and choir are used to mean groups of different classes, which is why they are used with plural verbs.\\n\\nThe 18th rule states that \"more than one\" should be followed by a singular verb. For example, \"More than one error was detected in the textbook,\" and \"More than one house has been destroyed by a fire disaster.\"\\n\\nWe hope you found these rules helpful. Stay tuned for more in our next class!',\n",
       " 'In the previous lesson, we discussed the strong rules of subject-verb agreement. Now, let\\'s move on to the concluding part, which is equally important. The 19th rule states that since the indefinite article \"a\" can only be used with a singular noun, \"mania\" must take a singular verb. For example, \"Many a private school is business-oriented.\" The same goes for \"church\" and \"year.\" The 20th rule states that \"it\" is used as a grammatical subject of an impersonal pronoun and must be used with a singular verb, regardless of the number of nouns or pronouns that follow it. For example, \"It is Toby that says so.\" The 21st rule states that plural determiners like \"some,\" \"many,\" \"most,\" and \"on\" are used with a plural verb. For example, \"Some students are here.\" The 22nd rule states that if there is a compound subject in which the two units mean the same thing, the verb must be singular. For example, \"The vice-chancellor and the head of the university was around.\" The same goes for \"commander-in-chief\" and \"head of state,\" as well as \"minister in charge\" and \"pastor in the office.\" That\\'s the end of the class. Keep practicing and evaluating your application of the rules of subject-verb agreement until we meet for class evaluations.',\n",
       " 'Alex was disappointed to discover that the supermarket where he usually spent his allowance on weekends had been temporarily shut down due to a recent shooting incident. The supermarket was always bustling with customers, and Alex loved going there because they had an entire floor dedicated to chocolate candy and other sweet treats that satisfied his cravings. Unfortunately, the supermarket had been robbed about a month ago and had also suffered a small fire incident the month before. These were special expenses or losses that businesses sometimes incur, which do not relate to their normal activities. For example, when the supermarket was robbed, it led to a loss since no money was received for the stolen items. This had to be recorded by the entity, and the profit or loss account was debited to show an expense, while the purchases account was credited. Similarly, when the fire occurred, the business recorded the loss in the same way. The honorable supermarket often took items for personal use, which is known as drawings. Drawings of goods were recorded at cost price since no profit was made, and the goods were not paid for. Drawings also had to be recorded by debiting the joint account and crediting the purchases account. Bad debts were another type of special expense or loss. Businesses often sell on credit to some customers who buy in bulk. When a customer cannot pay their debts, it becomes a bad debt. This can happen for a lot of reasons. Bad debts are recorded by debiting the bad debts account and crediting the debtors account. Sometimes, the customer pays back the debts, and the bad debt is recovered. If this happens, the debtors account is debited, and the bad debts account is credited. The supermarket had incurred all these special types of losses and had to plan how to recover its losses. Alex was sad, but he understood the need for the closure. I hope you understood this lesson. See you in my next class, guys!',\n",
       " 'At the end of every term, a student can assess their performance by checking the report card. The report card shows how well the student performed in all three terms for each class. By reviewing the report card, students can identify the subjects in which they excelled and the areas where they need improvement. Similarly, businesses also evaluate their progress at the end of the accounting year. During this time, closing entries are made to close the ledger accounts, and the balances are transferred to the final account. The business also matches its costs and expenses to revenue by making adjustments. These adjustments are similar to a report card, where each grade must be matched to the correct subject to determine how well the student is doing in each area. Accruals are revenue that the business has not yet received or expenses that the business has not yet paid for, but the service has already been enjoyed. For example, when a business has not paid its staff salaries, it is recorded as an accrual since the staff have already worked. If services are paid for in advance, it is recorded as a prepayment. Businesses also make adjustments to account for doubtful debts, which are debts that the business is unsure it will recover. Additionally, unsold items at the end of the year require adjustments. Errors in the records must be corrected at the end of the accounting period. When a business offers discounts to customers to encourage them to pay on time, it must make adjustments for the discounts. These adjustments help the business match costs and expenses to revenue at the end of the accounting period, providing a true view of how well the business is doing and areas that need improvement.

       " \"Your favorite dress, your best pair of shoes, your bicycle, and your school bag are all items that you cherish. However, you can't use them forever, even if you want to. As time goes on, they start to lose their value. The clothes do not look as nice anymore, the shoes start to wear out, and you need to remind your parents to get you a new school bag. Just like these items, fixed assets also lose their value. When an asset is continuously losing its quality, quantity, or value, it's called depreciation. For example, your favorite dress loses its value after some time. The same goes for buildings, vehicles, and other assets that business owners use. No one wants to lose something important to them, but assets lose their value for different reasons. Assets can rust, decay, or lose value due to other physical factors like erosion and heat. For instance, your shoes may get damaged because they got wet a lot. Using an asset continuously can also make it lose value because of wear and tear. Assets that depend on technology can also depreciate because of new technology. For example, people change their phones after some time because there is a new model that does more things than the old one. When a business starts to have more customers, the whole assets might lose value if they cannot meet the increase in demand. No matter how much we love our assets, we have to know that with time, they will not be as useful as they used to be. Businesses need to understand depreciation and the causes of depreciation so they can know which of their assets can lose value. I hope you enjoyed my class. See you in my next class, guys!\",\n",
       " \"```Their family decided to have a garage sale to get rid of old items around the house that were no longer being used. At first, Ungazi resisted selling their things, but finally agreed to sell a bicycle and a box filled with toys after their mom promised to get a new bicycle with part of the money they made from the garage sale. Their mom had written ten thousand naira on a piece of paper and placed it on the bicycle. Ungazy remembered clearly that their dad had gotten the bicycle for 12,000 naira two years ago. Why was their mom selling it for less? Assets lose their value after some time, just like in Ungazy's bicycle. This loss in value of assets is called depreciation, and businesses have to record depreciation of assets in the financial statement. Depreciation reduces the profit of the business since it is a loss in the value of the assets. Recording it will, in turn, reduce the tax the company pays. Recording depreciation can help the business have money to replace the assets when it loses its value. For example, if Ungazy's bicycle loses value by three thousand every year after two years, that is six thousand. If they keep three thousand aside for new bicycles, by the time the old bicycle is no longer useful, they should have kept enough money to buy a new bicycle. Depreciation helps the company know the real value of the asset. Lingard's bicycle has been in use for two years, so the new value is six thousand. If Angus agrees to sell the bicycle for ten thousand again, it is four thousand. Recording depreciation helps the company to know how much it has gained or lost from selling an asset. When Ungazy's mom had set the selling price of the assets at ten thousand naira, she had considered the loss of the value of the assets. Businesses should always consider the loss in the value of the assets when making their financial records. I hope you had fun in my class this time. See you in my next class, guys!```\",\n",
       " 'I just received a new bicycle as a gift from my mom, who kept her promise. My friend Gazi was interested in learning how to calculate the depreciation of a bicycle so she could sell it when she no longer needed it. Ngozi, on the other hand, wanted to know how to calculate the correct amount of depreciation for a bicycle and asked my mom for permission to use the internet to learn more about it. When calculating depreciation, several factors need to be considered, such as the cost of the asset, its useful life, and its scrap value. My new bicycle cost 20,000 and the store owner told me it could be used for 10 years if taken care of properly. The method of depreciation and the causes of depreciation, whether internal or external, also need to be taken into account. Ngozi tried to understand each point so she could calculate the depreciation of a bicycle, but she was unsure about the methods of depreciation. As it was getting late, Gazi decided to learn about the methods another day. I hope you enjoyed this task. See you in my next class!',\n",
       " 'It was another weekend and Ungazi had just returned from riding her new pink and shiny bicycle around the estate. The bicycle had a big basket in front where she kept her water bottle, snacks, and items when she ran errands. It also had an extra seat, which she used to take her brother to the playground in the estate. Ungazi smiled at her new bicycle and thought about how much she loved it compared to her old one. However, she knew that whenever she got another one, it would be bigger and better.\\n\\nLooking at her to-do list for the day, Ungazi realized that she had only one item left: learning about the methods of depreciation. There are different methods of depreciation, each with its own advantages. Once you choose a method, you cannot change it. One common method is the straight-line method, which works just like a straight line. If Ungazi wants to depreciate her bicycle using this method, she would divide the cost by the useful life to get the amount for depreciation. The straight-line method is easy to use and is the most common method of depreciation. Another method is the reducing balance method, which, unlike the name, reduces the depreciation chart every year. The sum of the digits method works with the sum of the years, so if the asset has a useful life of five years, the sum of the digits is one plus two plus three plus four plus five, which is fifteen. The evaluation method uses the new value of the assets for times when the assets increase in value. As Ungazi looked at the different methods, she realized that they were so different from one another that she still didn\\'t know which one to use for a bicycle.\\n\\nRealizing that it was getting late and she still had to pick up her brother from the playground, Ungazi decided that the depreciation lesson would have to wait. She got ready to go to the playground and thought to herself, \"Thank you for coming to my class today. See you in my next class, guys!\"',\n",

A classmate had asked her how to depreciate bicycles and cars, and Ngozi was happy to share her knowledge. She never would have thought that getting a new bicycle would lead to learning so much. \\n\\nThe topic for the next class was accounting for depreciation, and this time the teacher had instructed everyone to contribute to the discussion. There are two ways of accounting for depreciation: the whole method and the modern method. \\n\\nUngazi looked at the webpage and thought to herself that this is the 21st century, and no one uses old methods of accounting anymore. The modern method of depreciation is preferred by accountants. Under this method, two accounts are created: an asset account and a provision for depreciation account. \\n\\nEvery year, the depreciation is recorded as an expense in the profit or loss account and credited to the provision for depreciation account. For example, if an asset is bought for $20,000 and is expected to be used for five years with a depreciation charge of $4,000 every year, the $4,000 is recorded as depreciation expense in the profit or loss account every year and in the provision for depreciation accounting. \\n\\nUngazi thought about the bicycle she had recently received as a gift. The man at the shop promised it would last for five years, and if she provided $4,000 for depreciation every year, she could get a new bicycle for her brother in five years. She looked forward to the next accounting class. \\n\\nThank you for attending my class today. See you in my next class, guys!',\n",
       " '\"It was like a fun game trying to figure out what went into the gaps and empty spaces. Knowing what a different option meant helped to fill the gaps quickly. In accounting, records can be incomplete and the accountant needs to complete these records in order to prepare accurate financial statements. Businesses usually keep records of all their activities, including receipts and payments. With these records, they can prepare their profit or loss account and statement of financial position. Even when records are incomplete, accountants can prepare the statement of profit or loss and the statement of financial position by first preparing an opening statement of affairs. This statement shows the assets and liabilities of the business at the beginning of the period. The next step is to prepare accounts that show all receipts and payments. Control accounts can also be prepared to show sales and purchases. The receipts and payment accounts are then adjusted for accuracy and prepayments at the beginning and end of the period. The next thing to do is to calculate the provision for depreciation and other provisions. When all the necessary information has been gathered, the accountant can finalize the accounting records. Just like knowing the meaning of words can help you easily fill the gaps, understanding accounting concepts can help accountants prepare accurate financial statements.

Yet Tolu still had doubts. She was sure when the time came, the mom would start with the usual \"after all I\\'ve done for you\" speech, just like Tolu.\\n\\nSometimes, businesses have debts they are not sure they will recover. These debts are called \"doubtful debts,\" and the business cannot include them as assets in the statement of financial position since they are not sure about getting the money. The business has to make a provision for doubtful debts. The provision is an estimate of the debts that might not be collected from the debtor. If Tolu wants to make a provision for the money the mom owes her, she can make an estimate. If Tolu agreed to sell the chocolate for 500 naira, she can decide to make a provision for the 500 naira or an amount less than 500 naira.\\n\\nA provision is recorded as an expense in the profit or loss account. The estimates cannot be calculated accurately all the time. While the provision is first recorded, the profit and loss account is debited, and the provision for doubtful debts account is credited. If Tolu has recorded the provision of 500 naira and decided to reduce this later to 400 naira, she has to remove 100 naira from the provision for doubtful debts account and add 100 naira to the profit or loss account. If she wants to increase the provision to 600 naira, she will add 100 naira to the provision for doubtful debts account and remove 100 naira from the profit or loss account.\\n\\nNot all debts will be recorded by the business. When a business has doubts about recovering its debts, it has to make a provision for it. A provision is an expense in the profit or loss account, and it can always be increased or decreased based on the situation. Tony looked at the debt records and shook his head.

       " \"Nelson spent the whole day tidying up the house. His dad had offered to pay him if he did a good job, but when he asked for the money, his dad said he would pay later. Nelson was confused and asked why he couldn't get the money now. His dad told him to research what an accrual was and come back for the money when he found out. Businesses have to record their revenue and expenses relating to the revenue in the same period. So, if a business buys goods for sale, it has to record the money it got from selling the goods when the sale is made, even though the money for the goods is not paid immediately. His dad then told him to record the money for tidying up the house as an accrued income. Accrued income or accrued expenses are for services that have been received but not paid for. An accrual income is for services that have been given but money has not been received yet, like nursing or cleaning the house. Nelson explained what he thought an accrual was to his dad, and as promised, he got his money. His dad even paid in advance for the next time he cleaned. His dad told him it was a prepayment and he should record it too. A prepayment is the opposite of an accrual. It is the money paid in advance for a service not yet enjoyed.

She had been saving a portion of her allowance and money received from relatives in a piggy bank just for this occasion. Who doesn't love a good bargain? Fred had a long list of items he wanted to buy at a discounted price. This was going to be the best Black Friday ever!\\n\\nBusinesses offer discounts for various reasons. Sometimes, discounts are given to encourage people to buy more, like on Black Friday. Discounts can also be given to debtors to encourage them to pay their debts on time. Businesses have to make provisions for discounts so they can estimate how much they might actually receive from the debtors. For example, during Black Friday sales, the business has to provide for all the discounts that it is offering. This will be recorded as an expense since the business will not be receiving the full amount of money.\\n\\nThe amount of the discount is recorded in the profit or loss accounts as an expense. Provision accounts are made for both debtors and creditors. Creditors are the people the business owes money to. When provision is made for creditors, it is added to the profit or loss accounts as an income because the business gets to save the money. For example, if Faith wants to buy a bicycle on Black Friday for 12,000 naira instead of 15,000 naira, the 3,000 naira she saved is an income. \\n\\nFifth was smart as she filled her cart with all the items she had saved up for. With the discounts, she had saved a lot of money, almost 15,000 naira. She didn't even care that the business was losing money due to the discounts they had provided. They would be fine.

He wondered how he was going to find what he needed. He looked at the list of things he wanted to buy and scanned the surroundings. The items could be anywhere. As he pushed his cart towards the first aisle, he noticed a big sign above it with the words \"Perfumes, Deodorant, and Hygiene Products\". Tolu noticed similar signs at other aisles too, with different words. Maybe finding his items wouldn\\'t be so hard after all.\\n\\nJust like the supermarket, large organizations are also divided into departments. This is because they have a lot of transactions and different products, so dividing into departments makes it more convenient. When an organization is divided into departments, the operations are easier, just like the signs on each aisle in the supermarket make it easier to find what you want. Dividing the organization into departments is beneficial for accounting since transactions can now be categorized according to departments. Each department will keep their own journal and ledger. For example, each department has its own separate books for purchases and sales. So, in an organization like the supermarket, the books that show purchases and sales of items like soaps will be different from the books that show purchases and sales of beverages.\\n\\nAt the end of the year, all the books kept by the different departments are brought together by the accountants. This can help the accountants to know which departments are doing very well and which ones need to improve. The books are now combined to see how well the whole organization is doing. Donald Trump walked towards the counter. He had gotten everything on the list and had enjoyed walking around the supermarket, checking the signs to know what was in each aisle.

These expenses can occur frequently or once in a few years, and they can be of varying amounts. \\n\\nThere are two main types of expenses that a business can incur. When a business spends money to add value to its non-current assets, it is a capital expenditure. Capital expenditures do not occur frequently, and they usually involve a large amount of money. For example, if a business buys a piece of land and spends money on legal fees for the land, this is a capital expenditure. \\n\\nOn the other hand, payments for the day-to-day activities of the business are revenue expenditures. Repairing and maintaining non-current assets are also revenue expenditures. To determine if an expense is capital or revenue in nature, consider if it takes a long time to complete the project or has a long-term effect on the profit of the company. If so, it is a capital expenditure. If it only has a temporary effect, it is a revenue expenditure. \\n\\nCapital expenditures should be recorded in the statement of financial position, while revenue expenditures are recorded as expenses in the statement of profit or loss. If a capital expenditure is mistakenly recorded in the profit or loss statement, the value of fixed assets will not be correct, and the profit will be reduced. If a revenue expenditure is mistakenly recorded in the statement of financial position, the profit will be increased. Thank you for attending my class, and I hope to see you in the next one!',\n",
       " 'Have you ever wondered how businesses operate? How do they keep track of all their transactions and determine their profits? In a classroom, teachers have rules that they follow to ensure that everyone is graded equally. Similarly, businesses operate with rules and assumptions known as accounting concepts. These concepts help businesses exist for a long time, with the going concern concept assuming that the business will continue to operate. \\n\\nBusinesses are usually owned by people who invest money in them. However, with the business entity concept, the owner is seen as separate from the business. This means that the business only records things that affect it and not the owner. Financial statements are usually shown in terms of money because the money management concept states that only items that can be measured in terms of money should be recorded. \\n\\nWhen a business buys an asset, it should record the asset using the cost concept. Expenses and revenue are usually recorded when they are incurred or earned, even if the customer has not paid for the service immediately. This is known as the accrual concept. \\n\\nWithout accounting concepts, financial records would be chaotic, and there would be no double entry. It would be like a classroom without rules, where the teacher can reward their favorite students without considering the best students. Financial records need rules for us to be able to trust them. Thank you for attending my class, and I hope to see you in my next one.',\n",
       " '\"Many of the actions we take are guided by rules or laws. These rules are present in our homes, schools, and businesses. During exams, the rule is simple: do not cheat. In business, the rule is clear: the customer is always right. In life, the golden rule is to treat others how you want to be treated. Rules guide most things that we do, and we need rules to know the right things to do. In accounting, there are rules too. Accounting concepts and conventions are the rules and principles we have to consider when we prepare financial statements. Imagine solving a math equation like three plus six times four. If you use bad rules, your answer will be 27, while someone else could get 36 by solving without following the correct order of operations. Imagine if there were no rules, and every accountant could get different financial results from the same information. We trust financial statements to make sure that they have the same purpose. Generally accepted rules or principles are adopted for the preparation and presentation of financial statements. These rules are called accounting concepts and conventions. Accounting concepts are the assumptions that work in recording transactions and preparing accounts. The guidelines that help in recording transactions are accounting conventions. Accounting conventions are like the order of operations in math, where the letters guide us, and the assumption that using the correct order of operations will give us the right answer can be likened to accounting concepts. Rules are an important part of the things we do, and in order to be sure that financial records are uniform, we need to consider the rules and principles in place. Thank you for attending my class.

       " \"Foreign: Over and over again, it's amazing that chocolate could be made from the pod. John loved chocolate a lot and spent half of his allowance on it. He had a cocoa plantation, so he thought he would never have to spend on chocolate again. However, he realized that making chocolate wasn't going to be free. Even if he had cocoa, it still had to go through the whole process of manufacturing to get chocolates. The process of transforming raw materials to finished goods is called manufacturing. Cocoa is the raw material used to make chocolate, which is the finished product. Companies that manufacture buy raw materials to produce finished goods before selling them. So, a chocolate company would buy cocoa and produce chocolate so they can sell the chocolate. To keep a record of their transactions, manufacturing companies keep manufacturing accounts. Manufacturing accounts help the company to know how much they spend on production and how much profit they made. The amount spent on production is called the cost of production, and without knowing the cost of production, the profit cannot be known. The profit is gotten by deducting the cost of production from the sales to get the gross profit. After deducting expenses, the net profit of the manufacturing company can be calculated. John knew he would need to have a reasonable amount of money if he wanted to manufacture chocolates, even if it was just for himself alone. Thanks for coming to my class.

He filled some of the lemonade in plastic bottles and left the rest in a big bucket with a tap, which he had gotten for his lemonade stand. He also filled a cooler with ice cubes for those who wanted a cold drink and brought a jar each of honey and sugar because who doesn\\'t like something sweet? His younger sister had agreed to help them for a fee and was loading the items into the car. Jonah was interested in the profits he was going to make, so he had gotten a book to record all sales and costs. Just like manufacturing companies, he wanted to know his cost of production and profits. The cost of production is made up of the prime cost and factory overhead. The prime cost is the cost directly related to the production process, such as the cost of raw materials, labor, and all direct expenses. Jonah had gotten some lemons from his grandmother and had gotten the rest from the store for 5,000 naira. He spent 2,000 naira on the jar of honey, 1,000 naira on sugar, and was paying his sister 2,000 naira for helping him make the juice. His prime cost was 10,000 naira. The other costs that are not directly related to production are the factory overheads. Jonah had paid 4,000 naira for his spot at the trade fair and an extra 1,000 naira for electricity at the spot. He paid his sister 3,000 naira for helping him, making his factory overhead 8,000 naira. He sold 20 bottles of lemonade at 500 naira each, making 10,000 naira. His total sales were 30,000 naira. After removing his prime cost of 10,000 naira and factory overhead of 8,000 naira, he had made a profit of 12,000 naira. Jonah was really happy and thought to himself, \"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\" Thank you for attending my class, see you at the next one!',\n",
       " 'The Johnsons were moving to a new house after living in their old house since Adi was born. Adi had a hard time welcoming the change because his dad had just gotten a different job in the states and they all had to move. Adi was not happy about the change and wondered why his dad needed another job anyway. All Adi could think about on the drive to the new house was that his parents intended to sell the old house. Non-current assets can be sold for one reason or another by individuals, families, or businesses. When a business sells an asset, it is recorded in the asset disposal account. This account shows the profit or loss from selling the asset. Disposal of an asset can be recorded using two methods: the old and the new method of depreciation of the asset sold. If you use the old method, depreciation is removed from the asset account and the asset is sold. Cash is received, so the cash account is debited and the asset account is credited with the selling price. For example, if the asset was $30,000 before depreciation and depreciation is $5,000, the asset account now has a balance of $25,000. If the asset is sold for $40,000 and the business receives $40,000 cash, the profit of $15,000 is shown in the profit or loss account. If you use the modern method, a disposal account is created and the cost of the assets and the accumulated depreciation are transferred to the disposal account. So, every asset was bought by the business for $10,000 and the accumulated depreciation is $4,000. The two amounts are transferred to the disposal account. When the asset is sold, the cash account is debited and the disposal account is credited. Profits or losses are shown in the profit or loss account. Adi was amazed at the size of the new house. It was almost twice as big as the old one, and as his parents had said, the owner was willing to sell it to them after a year if they wanted it. Maybe selling the old house isn\\'t such a bad idea. \"I can make new memories here,\" Adi thought. Thanks for coming to my class. See you in my next class, guys!',\n",

During heavy rainfall, the neighborhood would come together to dispose of our waste by throwing it in bags into the river, thinking that the running water would carry it away. However, this caused the waste to pile up and obstruct the flow of the river. As a result, the river overflowed into the streets and people's houses, carrying away their belongings. Through this experience, I learned about the powerful effects of running water, which can cause flooding and wash away objects in its path. This makes running water one of the most significant agents of erosion. I hope you found this lesson informative and look forward to seeing you in the next one.\",\n",

Unlike stone and water, which are solids and liquids, the particles of gaseous substances are bound by very weak forces. That is why we can't see them because they are scattered all about. But we can feel them around. Try to breathe in and out. Can you feel the air in and out of your lungs? Great! What you just did now is breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Oxygen is a gaseous element that is very valuable to our existence. But is it only what we breathe in? Of course not! Oxygen also combines with water vapor in the atmosphere for the weathering of rocks, for soil formation, and that's not all. It is also an important element for industrial purposes. So, oxygen is an important resource for humans in the following ways: for respiration, combustion, existence of human life, combines with water vapor for chemical weathering, and for industrial purposes.

       " 'Do you know that water escapes into the atmosphere almost every second? Water is made up of molecules that are in constant vibration. This means that the molecules of water are in motion. However, only the molecules of water that are close to the surface are able to escape on their own. When water is heated and the temperature increases, the vibration increases, and that is when you see this movement in the form of steam. For example, when you boil water in a kettle, this same process happens. When the surface of seas, oceans, and rivers are heated up, water molecules escape into the atmosphere in the form of vapor. So, how is the escape of water into the atmosphere as water vapor important to us? It is important for the formation of rain. The rain formed is used by plants and animals. The rain formed is also useful in the process of chemical weathering. It helps to moderate the atmospheric temperature. In this lesson, we have been able to see the importance of water vapor in the atmosphere. Trust your heart for learning in this lesson. See you in the next lesson. Bye!',\n",

Rainfall is incredibly important as it is useful for both humans, plants, animals, and even non-living things. Rainwater is an essential element for the survival of plants, especially in areas where there are forests. You can see how thick, big, and heavy trees grow in forests because these areas are exposed to very heavy rainfall. Rainfall also makes soil formation possible because it combines with other chemicals in the atmosphere for the weathering of rocks. But that's not all, rain is also a source of water for agriculture and domestic use, feeding rivers, lakes, and oceans. Rainfall is humanity's hope that we won't run out of water. Lastly, anytime it rains, the atmosphere is always cool. The importance of rainfall as an environmental resource includes the provision of water for human consumption, the provision of water for agriculture, the reduction of heat and high temperature, and the availability of water in rivers and sources of underground water.

For example, there are certain plants that produce seeds that can grow into new plants. But if the seeds just fall to the ground under the parent plant, they might not get enough sun, water, or nutrients from the soil. Because plants cannot work around and take their seeds to other places, they need a dispersal agent like wind to help spread the seeds around. In other words, wind acts as an important agent for seed dispersal. \\n\\nNow let's see other ways wind can be useful.

In order to obtain certain resources, such as timber, we may have to engage in the process of lumbering, which involves cutting down trees. However, it's not just trees that are exploited in forests. Wild animals are also hunted for meat and leather, which is known as forest exploitation or exploitation of vegetation resources. However, it's important to note that forest exploitation can lead to a variety of problems. For example, if we cut down all the trees for timber, where will wild animals live? This can lead to the endangerment and extinction of many species. Additionally, areas that have been exploited can become exposed to direct sunlight, erosion, and flooding because the leaves of trees that provide shade have been removed. This can also lead to soil erosion, depletion of natural forest products, high costs of exploitation, soil leaching, flooding, transportation problems, and disappearance of wildlife. It's important to consider the potential consequences of exploiting vegetation resources before engaging in these activities.```\",\n",

Therefore, the disadvantages of renewable resources include the following: most renewable sources of energy are affected by weather, they could be wasted because they are readily available, and there is no optimum use of them. They can also cause natural disasters. Start following this lesson and see you in the next one.',\n",

Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent this from happening, which is why petroleum is classified as a non-renewable resource. Non-renewable resources are resources that cannot be renewed or recycled once they are used up. In contrast, renewable resources can be replenished over time. An example of a renewable resource is solar energy. Petroleum, on the other hand, cannot be renewed or recycled, making it a non-renewable resource. In summary, non-renewable resources are not sustainable because they cannot be replenished once they are used up. Examples of non-renewable resources include fossil fuels, such as petroleum, oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy.

Can you see how the discovery of petroleum has helped to improve how we use technology for our use? It has helped scientists and engineers to design things we can use, providing solutions to transportation issues with the advent of cars, ships, airplanes. When hydroelectric power fails, we have alternative generators to supply electricity and many more other innovations that have evolved since the discovery and availability of petroleum.

These two gases are carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. When fossil fuels are burnt or used, these three chemicals are often released into the environment. As we use cars, vehicles, and machines everywhere, this is one of the major causes of pollution in our environment. This is one of the major disadvantages of the use of non-renewable resources. Imagine if one day the world runs out of its petroleum reserves without an alternative to power our machines. This will cause a lot of problems. So, these are some of the disadvantages of non-renewable resources, including the fact that the resources are not renewable and when they run out, inevitably carbon dioxide and other climate gases are released in large quantities when fossil fuels and coal are used, leading to environmental pollution.

But, do you know that this beautiful environment that nature has blessed us with can be in serious danger? Yes, our manufacturing industries often release harmful chemicals into the atmosphere and our water bodies. Cars also release poisonous gases that pollute the air, and pouring waste into flowing rivers causes flooding. When we don't properly dispose of our waste, it can cause harm to our environment. Environmental hazards are disasters caused by nature or man's activities that pose serious danger to our lives and properties. I hope you learned a lot from this lesson.\",\n",

However, trees are also used to provide wood for manufacturing, firewood, pencils, and many other valuable things we use daily. Because these are things we cannot do without, hundreds of thousands of trees are cut down yearly for manufacturing in the forest. This process is known as deforestation, and it is one of the factors causing environmental hazards. Our forests are deteriorating, wildlife habitats are destroyed, causing floods, destruction of soil nutrients, and reducing the supply of oxygen. How can we prevent this? We must replace fallen trees by planting more trees and have fallen and that are falling back. We should also provide other sources of fuel from firewood, enlighten people about the danger of cutting trees indiscriminately, and have government policies to guide against deforestation.

If this happens over a long period of time, it is called a drought. A drought is a long period of time with high temperatures, low humidity, and cloud covering without rainfall. When this happens, streams and rivers dry up, plant growth is affected, and there is no food or oxygen supply for our survival. This poses a great threat and causes humans and animals to migrate from their environment. Can this be prevented?

But when we have plants and trees around us, we have less to worry about. Now, imagine what happens if there are no plants and trees. What danger will be in? What can we do to conserve our environment by ensuring we have trees and plants? \\n\\nThe first method is to plant where they don't exist, and this process is known as afforestation. Secondly, we can replant plants and trees that were removed in a process called reafforestation. We can plant cover crops like the carpet grass in areas that are exposed to flood and erosion. We can recycle used plastics instead of burning them. Improved farm techniques educate people about the importance of conserving our environment, and government policies against activities that can destroy our natural habitat. \\n\\nSo, in today's class, we have been able to learn things we can do to conserve our environment.

       " 'Did you know that some manufacturing industries in Nigeria still rely on foreign countries for their raw materials? Many of them also depend on skilled workers from outside Nigeria. For example, most of these industries are located in urban areas, but they source their raw materials from rural areas where primary activities like fishing, farming, lumbering, and hunting take place. Nigeria spends a significant amount of money importing goods and services such as cars, computers, machines, food, and refined petroleum because most of its industries are small-scale and mainly involved in light manufacturing processes like shoe making, catering, textiles, and food production. These industries require more labor than technical skills, and they are concentrated in a few locations, especially urban centers. Their products are mainly consumed in the local market. Therefore, they rely heavily on imported skilled labor and raw materials from foreign countries.',\n",
       " \"Have you heard about Dangote Cement Company in Nigeria? This is a company that transforms limestone into cement. When the company was about to start manufacturing cement in Nigeria, they carefully considered the best location. Do you know why? It's because limestone, which is a raw material for cement, is found in Ocean State. However, this wasn't the only reason why this area was chosen. The state was also chosen because of the government's policies and political stability, which encourages industries to be located in this area. Additionally, the availability of electricity, labor, and good road networks were also considered. Therefore, we can say that the factors affecting the location of manufacturing industries include proximity to the source of raw materials, nearness to the market, nearness to the source of power, availability of capital, availability of labor, adequate transport network, political stability, and government policies.

       " 'Did you know that the majority of the things we use every day are made by manufacturing industries? These industries produce a wide range of products, from light items such as matches, television sets, fans, books, and clothes to heavy and bulky products like cars, metals used in construction, and petroleum. However, manufacturing industries differ based on the products they produce. For example, the industry involved in the manufacturing of light products like matches and needles is different from the industry involved in the manufacturing of heavy materials like cars and the refining of petroleum. The industry that manufactures matches is classified as a lightweight industry, while the industry that manufactures ships and cars is classified as a heavy industry. But are these the only classes of industries? No, there are also industries involved in the manufacturing of consumable goods such as meat, milk, beer, coffee, and alcohol. These industries that deal with the manufacturing of food products are called consumer goods industries. So, the three main classes of industries are light industries involved in the manufacturing of lightweight goods, consumer goods industries involved in the manufacture of consumable goods, and heavy industries involved in the manufacturing of heavy materials.

       " 'Do you know why it is more expensive to travel by air than to travel by land? One of the reasons is because the cost of producing an airplane used in air transportation is much more than the cost of manufacturing a car or motorcycle. This means that the capital cost of starting an industry for the manufacturing of airplanes will be much more than the capital costs of starting a car manufacturing industry. Similarly, the cost of starting a building construction company will be much more than that of a food manufacturing industry. Here are the differences between heavy and light industry: heavy industries are usually large-scale in nature, while light industries are relatively small in plants and products. Heavy industries manufacture large products like airplanes, while light industries manufacture light products like blades. Heavy industries have a larger turnover from product sales than light industries. Heavy industries employ the services of more males, while light industries employ more females.

       " \"How many stages do you think are involved in the process of turning raw materials, like wood, into a finished product, like paper? Let's look at the process together. Wood is obtained from trees, right? So, the first primary activity is cutting down trees. This process is called lumbering. Then, the wood is transported to large factories where the next stage of manufacturing is carried out. The second stage involves many processes before the wood from the tree becomes paper. Now that the paper is ready, what do you think is next? The paper is taken to the market to be sold to people who make use of it. Until this stage, manufacturing is not complete. Can you now see that industries can also be classified according to their functions? The first class of industry involves primary activities of making raw materials available, like lumbering, mining, fishing, hunting, and farming. The second class of industries involves secondary activities of turning the raw materials into finished and consumable goods. Examples of secondary industries include construction, textiles, shipbuilding, iron and steel, and chemical industries. Lastly, there are tertiary industries that are involved in rendering services with manufactured goods, like trading, banking, teaching, medical, and transportation.

People from different places come to patronize her goods because she sells them at a very affordable price compared to other traders. Mrs. Bissy is able to sell at a cheaper price and attract plenty of customers to herself because she gets her goods at a far cheaper price directly from the manufacturers. The major advantage she has is that all the manufacturers of her goods are located in Lagos where the majority of the manufacturing industries are located. This concentration of industries in Lagos creates an avenue for her to spend less time sourcing for her goods at once.

       " 'If you were to start an industry producing designer shoes and leather, did you know that the best location would be an area where other manufacturing industries are present? For instance, a trader who deals in products like manufacturing industries would prefer to go to a location where they can get all the goods they want to sell at once, without having to go to different places. This is because when merchants and traders can source marketable goods in the same area, it reduces the cost of transportation and saves time. It also creates healthy competition among industries, as when traders go for a particular product made by one industry, other industries get competitive and want their products to be purchased as well. This competition leads to innovation, and industries can come together to develop associations and attract development in that area. The advantages of concentration of manufacturing industries in a particular area are independence of industries, creation of employment opportunities, mobility of labor, provision of social amenities, healthy competition among industries, invention and innovation due to competition, development of cooperative societies, and attraction of subsidiary industries in the same area.

However, did you know that this region experiences a lot of pollution because of the petroleum industries that are concentrated in this area? The activity leads to a lot of pollution, including air pollution from gaseous substances from machines, water pollution from the release of toxic waste, and even land pollution resulting from oil spillage. As a result, people in this area cannot cope and have to move to the city where there is less industrial activity. There will be an increase in unemployment when there are no jobs, and people are unable to farm due to pollution, leading to an increase in crime rates such as stealing and armed robbery.

       " 'Foreign, if you were asked for the best solution to the problems facing manufacturing industries, what would you suggest? Many times, the best solution comes from the government. Do you know why? Because the government makes policies that guide all activities in the state or country. For example, the capital required to keep many industries running is so much that it cannot be acquired by individuals. Even small-scale industries still need extra funds to meet up with production and supplies. The government can provide a solution to these problems by giving incentives and loans to these industries. Transportation and location of production are also major problems that can be solved by the construction of good roads and the creation of industrial zones. Moreover, there is a need for more people to be trained with the necessary skills to handle the manufacturing process in many of these industries. When skill acquisition is available, more people can be employed by the industries. Therefore, the solution to the problems facing manufacturing industries includes the following: acquisition of skills, good government policies, active government participation, incentives to local industries, provision of transport facilities, creation of industrial zones, establishment of industrial banks, stable government, and so on.

       " \"```Welcome to your government class. Today, we will be discussing the process of elections. To bring it closer to home, have you ever wondered how your class captain is chosen? In most cases, your class teacher makes the decision without asking for your opinion. However, this is not how elections work in a democratic system. Unlike how your class teacher chooses your class captain, the people of a country or location are allowed to make a choice as to who will lead them through various political offices. This process is known as an election. \\n\\nIn every country with a democratic government, elections are held periodically to choose leaders for various governmental offices at different levels. For example, in Nigeria and many African states, leaders are elected to political offices such as the president, governor, senate, house of representatives, house of assembly, local government, and so on. In simple terms, an election is the process of choosing candidates into political or governmental offices. In many cases, it can be likened to a contest between a number of political parties alongside their candidates. The winner of this contest becomes the holder of such office. This contest is done through canvassing for votes and candidates selling their agenda. \\n\\nFrom the look of things, we can say that elections have their advantages or functions. In the case of your class teacher choosing a class captain of his or her choice, there's a possibility that this person may perform badly. If your class teacher had taken some time to consult members of the class about the person's character, all that could have been avoided. However, as it concerns elections, rather than give the political office to just anybody, the person deemed qualified by the people becomes the holder of said office. Such a person is expected to represent their interests and opinions to the best of his or her abilities. This, in turn, makes the winning candidates responsive to the needs of the people. \\n\\nAnother advantage of elections is that it aids the smooth running of government. What a chaos it would be if there were no process of changing the leaders in government. But with elections, a smooth transition of government is enabled. Additionally, elections serve as an opportunity to educate the people about their nation and its needs and issues. Not only this, it brings people of different ethnic groups together, especially when they are supporting individual candidates. \\n\\nThat's all for now. In our next class, we shall consider the disadvantages or demerits of elections. See you in the next class!```\",\n",
       " \"As already stated in the last class, elections are the process for choosing candidates for political or governmental offices. In today's class, we shall consider the disadvantages or demerits of elections. Welcome once again. Even though elections are advantageous in many ways, there can also be disadvantages. For example, they can lead to disunity. In the case of your class captain, imagine if your teacher allows you and your classmates to choose a candidate of your choice. Do you think you will come up with the right person for the job? In many cases, there's a possibility that you would choose someone who will let you do what you like, make noise, for example. The possibility that you would choose the right person for the job is not high. You and your fellow classmates may appoint Segun, the funniest person in your class, instead of Cassie, an intelligent and orderly person who may actually be a better leader. This leads us to one of the disadvantages of elections: people may end up choosing the wrong candidates for the job due to one reason or another. \\n\\nAnother disadvantage is that it is hard to find an unopposed candidate for a political office. Like in the case of Cassie and Segun, you and your classmates may be divided in your support. In the case of a political election, this may lead to antagonism and civil unrest. In addition, elections tend to marginalize minority groups. These groups may not possess the population influence, money, or power, thereby leading them to being overlooked when considering holders of political offices. \\n\\nAnother disadvantage of elections is that when not conducted in a free and fair manner, elections are fraught with malpractices like rigging, stealing of ballot boxes, bullying of the electorate, and vote buying. All these contribute to the putting of corrupt leaders into government. Uneven development can also occur when a certain group of people did not vote for the ruling political party. This raises issues of favoritism, nepotism, tribalism, and so on. \\n\\nFinally, elections are expensive to conduct. These are some of the disadvantages of elections. In the next class, we will consider the major types of elections we have. See you there!\",\n",
       " \"So far, in our previous classes, we have examined elections as a vital part of government. We defined elections and considered their advantages and disadvantages. In today's class, we will discuss the major types of elections. There are two types of elections: direct and indirect elections. \\n\\nImagine your class teacher asks you to tear out a sheet of paper and write the name of your preferred candidate for the position of class captain. Then she asks you to fold the paper and drop it in a basket. Similarly, in a direct election, people are allowed to vote for the candidate of their choice by themselves, as long as they are qualified voters. In contrast, in indirect elections, voting is done through representatives known as the electoral college. It can be likened to your teacher choosing certain people in your class to come up with a suitable candidate for the position of class captain. \\n\\nBoth types of elections have advantages and disadvantages. For direct elections, people have the opportunity to vote without interference, show interest in how their country is being run, and the equality of each voter is preserved. However, this instance seems well until it is discovered that the voters lack political education. Such is the case in many developing countries where candidates influence voters with promises of a better life only to get into power and do otherwise. Many times, miscreants are sent to harass voters, and elections are rigged. \\n\\nIn the case of indirect elections, the advantages lie in the fact that it is less expensive, less violent, and the electoral college has more informed members of society who vet the candidates before casting their votes. However, this kind of election is prone to bribery, an easy influence. Not only that, the interests of the people may not be adequately represented, which makes it less democratic. \\n\\nThis brings us to the end of the class. See you next time!\",\n",
       " \"After examining the meaning and types of elections, as well as their advantages and disadvantages, let's move on to the topic of voting. Voting during an election involves choosing a candidate for a political office. There are two major systems of voting: open or public ballot and secret ballot. Just like choosing your class captain, any of these systems may be employed by your class teacher. In this lesson, we will focus on the open ballot system. \\n\\nIn the open ballot system, voting is carried out in public, in the view of the candidates. Voters may line up behind their chosen candidate or their poster, or they can vote by a show of hands. This eliminates the need for ballot papers, ballot booths, and other materials, making it a cheaper system of voting. Other advantages include simplicity, prevention of rigging, and easily ascertainable results. Additionally, election results are known in a short period of time. \\n\\nHowever, the open ballot system has a number of flaws. By its very nature, it encourages victimization and intimidation of opponents, which often leads to enmity between opposing sides. For example, if your candidate did not win, the person who did may abuse their power and victimize you. Other disadvantages include disenfranchisement of some persons in society, such as wealthy and influential individuals who may consider it beneath them to queue up with the masses. It is also hard to maintain maximum security in an open ballot system, especially in a country with a large population. Lastly, where there is a large crowd, voting will be time-consuming, further discouraging voters from coming out for elections. \\n\\nConsidering these disadvantages, it is unlikely that anyone is still in favor of the open ballot system of voting. In the next lesson, we will consider the secret ballot system of voting. See you in the next class!\",\n",
       " \"So far, we have discussed the open ballot system of voting. Now, let's explore the secret ballot system, which is more widely used in democracies. In this system, voters choose their candidates in complete secrecy. They receive a ballot paper with the names and symbols of the contesting parties or candidates, go into a private space, and mark their candidate of choice before dropping the ballot paper in the ballot box. The advantages of this system are that voters can choose their candidates without fear of intimidation or victimization, and it encourages political participation. It's similar to writing the name of your preferred class captain on a piece of paper and dropping it in a collection basket passed around the class. However, this system is expensive to operate due to the cost of the ballot boxes, papers, and other materials. It also encourages election malpractices like rigging. Additionally, if voters don't understand how to handle the ballot papers, it can lead to casting invalid votes. Lastly, it's time-consuming. These are the basics of the secret ballot system of voting. In the next class, we'll discuss other types of voting. See you then!\",\n",
       " 'We have been learning about various types of voting. In this lesson, we will briefly consider other types of voting apart from the secret and open ballot system. These include compulsory voting, optional voting, voting by post, voting by proxy, and secret-open voting. In compulsory voting, everyone is required to vote as it is their civic duty. Failure to vote is considered a criminal offense. On the other hand, optional voting allows eligible voters to decide whether or not to vote. Voting by post allows registered voters to vote by mail, enabling them to vote outside of their registered area. Voting by proxy allows registered voters to vote through an authorized representative. Finally, secret-open voting is a combination of the secret and open voting systems. Here, voters are counted in an open space and made to vote in secret for whomever they please. These are the other types of voting apart from open and secret ballots. See you in the next class!',\n",

If you\\'ve been paying attention, you will recognize a phrase that has been commonly used in these lessons about elections and voting. Any guesses? It\\'s the phrase \"free and fair election,\" and today we will be examining the meaning and implications of this phrase.\\n\\nDo you consider it free and fair if your teacher chooses a class captain of their choice without asking for your opinion? What if she says two candidates should be nominated and voted for, and then one of them bribes your classmates with candies before the election? Would you consider it free and fair?\\n\\nWell, as it concerns elections in a democratic system of government, a free and fair election refers to conducting elections in an atmosphere that is free of harassment, intimidation, and other coercive means. An election that is characterized by the stealing of ballot boxes, rigging of elections, or buying of votes cannot be considered free and fair. If a nation claims to run a democratic government, then it must conduct free and fair elections.\\n\\nHow should it go about this? It should first of all establish an independent electoral commission. This means that such a commission must not be easily influenced or allow any outside interference. To achieve this, electoral officers must be well paid and well trained. Also, the country should be divided into equal constituencies for equal representation. The legislature should make electoral laws to be followed by this commission. Votes should be counted publicly and under strict security.',\n",

They introduced new ideas that were different from what the Nigerians were used to. For instance, they believed that the government should be a unified body, and Nigeria should have a single leader, like a president. To achieve this, they appointed governors in each state who were in charge of all the affairs, but they still reported to Lord Lugard. The Europeans allowed some traditional rulers to remain in power to avoid taking away all of Nigeria's ideas. Additionally, due to Africa's vastness, the Europeans decided to group it and give it different names. The first group was called the Crown Colony, where the military had total control because it was where the Europeans lived.

There are many reasons why Europeans came to Africa, but some of the most important ones are that they needed our raw materials to create different things in their industry. Unlike Africans, the Europeans were not blessed with raw materials like petroleum, coal, and so many other things. Also, they came to Africa because they wanted to bring the idea of Christianity to us and to get us interested in their products. Back then in Nigeria, people didn't know about some of the things we take for granted today, like sugar cubes, ceramic plates, etcetera. The Europeans also came to Africa because they were curious and simply wanted to explore a new place. Some of them also said they came simply because they wanted to help the Nigerian economy and stop the slave trade. Lastly, one of the most important reasons why they came was to have more political power. When they could, they didn't give Nigerians the opportunity to rule.

Just like how the British ruled Nigerians, the French ruled over many countries like Senegal, Togo, and so many others. They didn't allow them to be themselves. The French came into their lives and placed their own rules and ways of doing things in these countries. They even went as far as to appoint leaders for the people. You might wonder why the French government did that to the West Africans. Well, it's because they felt they were better than Africans and Africans should adjust their way of life.

The French came from France and told them that their way of life wasn't sustainable, and the only way they could survive was by adopting the French way of life. This was very sad because the French didn't allow these countries to choose for themselves; they forced their way of life on them. They decided that four communities, namely Daca, Gorilla, Rofisk, and Saint Louis, would be the first to be changed using their policy of assimilation. The policy of assimilation was meant to create a more organized way of government and to properly divide West Africa. Unfortunately, the policy didn't allow everyone to get an education and divided people into two groups: a special set of people and others. In conclusion, the policy didn't favor the people of the villages it was practiced on. Instead, it disrespected African culture, and Africans were treated badly by the French. I hope you had fun in this class. See you in my next class, guys!\",\n",

When the French government realized that their new policy of assimilation for West Africans wasn't working, they decided not to give up. Instead, they put their heads together and came up with another policy similar to the indirect rule in Nigeria. This new policy was called the Policy of Association and was very different from the Policy of Assimilation. The new policy didn't ignore the people's culture or try to change it. Instead, it included the culture as part of the policy. Because of how much the people hated the last policy, this new one removed every form of discrimination and gave traditional rulers more power instead of ignoring them. Each part of the territories was also allowed to have their freedom, all they needed to do was report to the French masters. Finally, the policy removed any form of forced labor and slavery, giving room for more French persons to work, not just in Africa. Thank you for watching.

The British government decided to go with the indirect rule of government, while the French government thought it would be best to use the direct rule of government. The French didn't value or respect the traditional rulers, in fact, they locked them down. But the British government knew that they must respect the traditional rulers if they want to succeed. Also, the British government thought it would be wise to allow people to form their own political patterns so that each part of the country will be able to grow and build themselves. The French, on the other hand, were more strict in their approach. They didn't want any political party to be formed, in fact, they didn't want the people to have freedom. Education was very important to the British, so they allowed everyone to have access to school and education. But the French didn't want that. They only allowed a few persons to go to school. Finally, just like a coin, the British and French government had the same goal, which is to colonize Africa, but they used different methods that gave different results. Amazing! Hope you had a great time watching. See you in the next class. Bye!\",\n",
       " '\"I am sure that you love your family and would do everything in your power to protect them from harm. Similarly, Africans came together and decided that they did not want foreigners to rule over them. They wanted to take control of their homeland back. They had a spirit of unity and made up their minds to fight for what was important, which was their country. What African countries decided to do is called nationalism. Nationalism simply means Africans coming together to reject colonizers and fight for their freedom. You might wonder how they were able to achieve this. It wasn\\'t easy, but they were determined because they were tired of being used as slaves, being hated because of their skin color, and paying heavy taxes even when they were working hard. They understood that they had the power to form political alliances, and they knew they had to use these opportunities to achieve nationalism. Finally, the people were pushed to fight for themselves because they wanted more educational facilities and more opportunities to build their countries the way they wanted. It\\'s amazing to learn about this history. I hope you had a great time learning. See you in the next class. Bye!\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sure you must have wondered how Africans came together to fight for their rights. Although, when the idea to fight for their independence came, many people were not comfortable with it. After a while, people began to like the idea. Let me tell you why. There was a war that happened, and it made everyone realize that the white people were not as powerful as they thought. Everyone has the right to decide what government they want to influence them. Also, when other countries like Ghana got their independence, Nigerians realized that it could happen to them too. Educated Nigerians like Navi Azikwe, Habibat McAuley, Obafema, and many others decided to kick against it. Christians noticed that God created everyone equally, so no one should be considered better or greater than another person. Finally, when soldiers who went to fight in the war came back, they brought new ideas. This caused a lot of people to believe that change can happen. Yes, it can! Hope you had a great time learning. I\\'ll see you in the next class. Bye!\"',\n",
       " \"Foreign countries were not always called Nigeria, and they were ruled by the British. When the British came to the country, they began to change things that happened, even though some people were uncomfortable with trained people coming to the country. However, they didn't have a choice. What the British government did was known as colonialism. Although most people would say that colonialism was bad, it still had broad positive results. Some of the positive things that happened during colonialism were the development of a common language. Most countries didn't have a single language that everyone could understand. For instance, the general language we speak in Nigeria is English. Without English, we most likely would not be able to understand each other, and this happened because of colonialism. Colonialism also brought the development of political parties and made people understand the need for organized government. Before colonialism happened, the system of government practiced was not organized. Another important benefit of colonialism was the technical, military support, and development that happened in the community. If colonialism hadn't happened, there wouldn't have been good roads, military men to protect us, and we would mostly likely still believe in more houses. Most importantly, they brought education, which has opened doors for many people, including you and me. In conclusion, colonialism didn't just happen in Nigeria alone; it happened in other countries in Africa, and they benefited a lot from it. We can learn from it. I'll see you in the next class. Bye.\",\n",
       " \"Foreigners came into your house and started controlling how long you should watch television or even stay on your phone. You would feel bad if colonialism took Africa by surprise. The British and French governments came and demanded to rule them, making them feel inferior. Even though the British and French governments brought positive changes to Africa, they still had negative effects that the people didn't like. The colonizers came to Africa to take some of the natural resources like gold and coal from the people. They used African goods and property to make themselves rich while they left Africans in poverty. Another thing they did was to create disunity among Africans. All the countries in West Africa were like siblings, but because different colonizers came to them, they began to speak different languages which created distance among them. The colonizers also introduced slavery to Africa. In their homes, Africans became slaves. They were beaten and punished in the daily work of hard labor. Traditional rulers who had a lot before became useless. They used them instead of allowing them to use their power. The colonizers also made Africa ignore their languages and made them learn strange languages. In conclusion, colonialism brought both good and negative effects. Thank you for watching. I'll see you in the next class.\",\n",
       " \"Have you ever heard about the Queen of England? In case you haven't, let me tell you about her. She is the ruler of the whole of Britain, but she doesn't need to physically go anywhere in Britain to govern. This is because she operates a type of government called the indirect system of government. This system of government was brought to Nigeria by Lord Lugard, who is known as the father of indirect government. \\n\\nYou might wonder what an indirect form of government is. It simply means that the British government rules over people by using the local chiefs and rulers. All the British government would do is to supervise them. The indirect system of government was put in place because the British government didn't have enough people to rule in every part of the country, and it would be very expensive to send people all over Nigeria. \\n\\nLord Lugard saw that the indirect system of government worked in other countries, so he decided it was going to work in Nigeria too. Finally, the British government loved the Nigerian culture, and even though they wanted to see good changes in the country, they decided it would be best to use the indirect form of government so that Nigeria wouldn't lose its culture. That's why we still have Ego and other cultural practices. \\n\\nI hope you enjoyed learning about the indirect system of government in Nigeria. See you in my next class, guys!\",\n",
       " '\"Do you have prefects in your school? If so, it\\'s a perfect example of an indirect rule of government. Your teachers and academic staff cannot be everywhere at the same time, so the prefects are responsible for some things. However, they always report to the teacher or principal whenever necessary. This system of ruling was implemented in Northern Nigeria after Lord Lugar decided he wanted an indirect rule of government. The indirect system of ruling worked perfectly for them because it helped them keep their culture instead of making them accept another way of doing things. At that time, most Northerners couldn\\'t speak or eat English, so it was hard for them to reject that type of ruling. The entire type of governing helped them because their emirs used to behave like no one should be able to talk to them. Finally, the indirect rule worked perfectly for them because it made their way of life more organized, which gave them peace. I hope you understand. See you in my next class, guys!\"',\n",
       " 'Unlike in Northern Nigeria, bringing indirect rule to Europa land was a little bit difficult. At that time, Europa land was ruled by the Hovers and the Hobbers were not comfortable with the idea of taking orders from someone who was not part of their community. The use of indirect rule in Western Nigeria was not as successful as in the North because the Europa people did not respect outsiders as they should have, unlike the North where people were educated and more open-minded. The Europa people were not comfortable with the idea of strangers coming into their town and telling them how to live their lives. Most of them were Christians, and Christianity was louder than Islam, so they kicked against it. This even caused a riot when they heard that the government wanted them to pay taxes. The educated people among the Europa people decided they would not agree to this plan and decided to stay away from that system. In fact, the educated men believed that since the North was different from the South, what worked for the North might not work for the South. Finally, when Lord Lugar decided to give power back to the Laughing of Oil instead of the Onion of Ife, he made the Europa people reject him because they believed that the Oni was their leader and Ife was their own. I hope you understand this class. See you in my next class, guys.',\n",
       " \"Although Lord Lugar tried to implement indirect rule and succeeded to some extent, it was difficult for the Egbo people to accept it. In fact, they rejected it completely. Let me tell you why. The Egbo people practiced democracy, where the people were their own rulers. So, the idea of answering to another person was something they did not agree with. Also, since the Egbo people did not have anyone they could point out as their ruler, it was difficult for Lord Lugar's idea to resonate with them. One thing Lord Lugar and his people wanted was for everyone to be uneducated so they could use their lack of education as a way to confuse or control them. However, the educated people among the Egbo were smart and kicked against this. Finally, because the Egbo people were predominantly Christians, it was hard for them to blindly obey their leaders without asking questions, unlike the Northerners. Hope you enjoyed this class. See you in my next class, guys!\",\n",
       " \"Lord Lugar implemented indirect rule not just to control people, but also because it was a cost-effective way to operate. It helped save money in day-to-day activities, preserved the unique cultures and regions, and fostered better relationships between people and their leaders. The leaders themselves benefited from the system as it taught them responsibility and hard work. Indirect rule also helped to eradicate harmful practices such as the killing of twins. However, the system made it seem like the leaders were being used by British officers. This led to educated individuals feeling like outcasts and the leaders not being held accountable for their actions. Additionally, the indirect rule system did not prioritize the rights of the people and even encouraged tribalism and favoritism. I hope you enjoyed this class and I'll see you in my next one!\",\n",

       "\"Welcome to class!In todayâ€™s class, we will be talking more about crops' plant form. Enjoy the class!Classification of Crops based on Life Span (Annual, Biennial, Perennial Crop)Crops complete their processes of growth at different lengths of time. Hence, crops can be classified as follows - annual, biennial, and perennial.Annual Crops (e.g. maize, yam, etc.)Biennial Crops (e.g. ginger, pineapple, cassava, etc)Perennial Crops (e.g cocoa, mango, etc.)I will be explaining them for more understanding;Annual Crop:Annual crops are crops that complete their life cycle (length of life) within one year or in one growing season. These crops grow into maturity, flower, produce seeds, and eventually die within one year. Annuals are plants that complete their life cycle in one year. They germinate, grow, bear fruits and die off within a year. Generally, all herbs and plants belonging to the grass family exhibit this type of life cycle. Examples are maize, rice, sorghum, soya beans, guinea corn, cowpea, sweet potato, cotton, tomato, yam, etc.The Lifespan of RiceRice is a type of grass and is the staple food for millions of people across the world. It is an annual crop with an average lifespan of 4 â€“ 8 months. It goes through three main stages before it is harvested â€“ the vegetative stage, reproductive stage, and ripening stage.Biennial Crop:They are plants that complete their life cycle in two years. They germinate, develop a root system, stem and leaves in the first year. Later in their second year, they yield flowers and bear fruits. A few herbs are also classified as biennials, including spinach. Along with spinach and other herbs, biennials also include carrot, cabbage, petunias radish, onions, etc.Perennial Crop:Perennials are plants that complete their life cycle in more than two years. Once they grow, they start to bear flowers, produce fruits, seeds and the cycle continues for a longer period. They do not die after bearing fruits but renew their parts, season after season. Along with a few shrubs, trees are all classified into perennials. For example, tomatoes, ginger, banana, mango, coconut, palm, banyan, etc.CROP PESTPest is an animal that injures or kills cultivated plants. The common pests are mammals, birds, and insects.INSECT PEST Biting and Chewing Insects: These insects with mouthparts adapted for biting and chewing crops, e.g. beetles, weevils, grasshoppers, locusts, etc.Piercing and Sucking Insects: These are insects, which have mouthparts for piercing plants' tissues and sucking out their content. e.g mealy bugs, aphids, butterflies, cop sides, etc.Boring Insects: These insects eat up grains, roots, and stems of plants. Examples include rice weevils, bean weevils, maize weevils, goats, monkeys, bats squirrels, etc.METHODS OF PREVENTING AND CONTROLLING CROP PEST\\xa01. Physical Control Method: Hand-picking and destruction of insectsScarecrow- To scare birds from farmTraps2. Cultural Control Methods: Crop rotationPloughingTimely harvestingTimely and regular weedingEarly planting3. Biological Control Methods:This involves the introduction of parasites and predators to destroy pests e.g snakes, birds, and frogs eat insects.4. Chemical Control Methods: Using of insecticidesUsing of nematicidesFumigation5. Quarantine:This is a temporary rule or law intended to help preserve and prevent animals, plants, and seeds with diseases from spreading.PROPAGATION OF CROPCrop propagation is the process of creating new plants from a variety of sources. There are two main types of soil propagation Sexual propagationAsexual propagationSexual Propagation: This involves the union of the pollen (male) with the female egg to produce seed.Advantages of Sexual Propagation It is a cheap method of propagation.It is a sure method of crop improvement since cross pollution results in variability.Disadvantages of Sexual Propagation Some plants produce very few seedsSome seeds do not germinate easilyAsexual Propagation: This is the production of a new plant, using part of the parent plant.Methods of Asexual Propagation Budding: This is a form of asexual reproduction in which a new organism develops from an outgrowth or bud due to cell division of one particular site.Grafting: This involves the uniting of a whole shot or stems into another plant. The stem is to be grafted onto a rootstock called a scion.Layering: In layering, parts of the plants are made to develop roots while they are still hatched to the parent plants.Cutting: When parts of a plant are cut into portions and planted to produce new plants. The cutting may be from stems, leaves, or roots. An example is the cutting of cassava stems.Advantages of Asexual Propagation They are more resistant to pests.Some plants have no seeds so they can be propagated asexually.One variety of crop can be produced indefinitelyDisadvantages of Asexual Propagation It cannot be used to achieve crop image improvement since it does not alter the genetic constitution of the plants.The disease can be transmitted if care is not taken during propagation.A limited number of plants and difficulty in handling.CULTURAL PRACTICESCultural practices involve all the activities carried out on the farm before, during, and after the planting of crops.Pre-Planting Operations:These are the farming operation carried out before planting. Such as: Selection of siteClearingStumpingPlottingTillingPloughingHarrowingRidgingSeed selectionNursery practicePlanting Operations: These are activities done during planting.They are: Planting datePlanting distanceSeed rateSowing depthPlantingNursery practicesTransplantingPost-Planting Operation:These are activities done after planting.They are: ThinningSupplyingMulchingManure or applicationWateringWeedingPest and disease controlProcessingCROP PLANT FORM (MONOCOTYLEDON AND DICOTYLEDON)A crop is any plant that has a useful purpose or economic value. Crop plants are grouped into two forms based on the structure of their seeds or the number of seed leaf it contains. Seed leaf is otherwise known as\\xa0cotyledon. Food for germinating seeds is stored in the cotyledon.Monocotyledonous CropThese are plants with one seed leaf or cotyledons e.g. oil palm, coconut, banana, plantain, pineapple, date-palm, garlic, sugarcane, cereals e.g. wheat, millet, rice, maize, sorghum, rye, barley, oats, and all grasses e.g. guinea grass, carpet grass, etc.Dicotyledonous CropDicotyledon, by name\\xa0dicot, is any member of the flowering plants, or angiosperms that has a pair of leaves, or cotyledons, in the embryo of the seed. Most common garden plants, shrubs and trees, and broad-leafed flowering plants such as magnolias, roses, and geraniums.We hope you enjoyed the class.Should you have any further questions, feel free to ask in the comment section below, and trust us to respond as soon as possible.\""
