       "1348  hello again, welcome,for a car to move from one destination to another, it is important that the wheels keep working continuously until it arrives at the expected destination. in computer programming, an operation can be continuous until a result is reached, usually referred to as loop. what is a loop?                                                                                                                                                     a  loop is referred to as a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition or result  is reached. to express the condition that an operation should rely on, then we have to learn how to write conditional statements,if statement                                                                                                                                               this is use to execute an operation based on some condition, it loops through a code block multiple times. for example;if( condition) {code or operation to execute; }let practicalize it,<script>if( 2 >  0) {       alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 }</script>if else statementthis statement is used when you want to execute a code each time the first if condition evaluates to false. the else statement must follow if or else if statement. for example;  if( condition) {code or operation to execute; }else {execute another operation;}<script>if( 2 ,  0) {       alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 } else{   alert(\"2 is not greater than 0\");                   }</script> else if statement: just like the if statement, this is used when you want to execute a code each time the first if condition evaluates to false. the else if statement is used when there is a second level condition and the major difference is that it allows multiple conditions after the if statement. for example; <script> if( 2 >  0) {        alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 } else if (2==0) {    alert(\"2 is not greater than 0\");                   } </script>   types of loops in javascriptfor loop: this enables looping through a block of code multiple times. to write a for loop, three important things are required;1. initializer:  this helps to define or declare a counter variable for the condition or a variable where our operation begins. 2. condition: this is the condition our operation depends on, it is on this the iteration depends on.3. iteration: this serves as the increment or decrement to our initialized variable.for example;<script>for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) { console.log(i); }</script> in the above, var i = 0, is the initializer.i < 7, is the condition.i ++, is the iteration.for in loop/ for of loop:these loop type are used to loop through the property of an object, for example; const name = {firstname:\"gabriel\", secondname:\"isaac\", age:45};let text = \"\";for (let x in name) {  text += name[x] + “”;}console.log (text)from this example, you should remember, javascript operator, which we used to run our operation.first you declare a variable as an object, so you declare an empty string that you will store the properties you looped through, then you remember you want to loop through this object using the for in loop,  which we did with the                                         for (let x in name)followed by the operation which is the                                           text += name[x] + “”;for the for of loop, example is belowconst names = [\"gabriel\", \"isaac\", \"lonimi\"];let text = \"\";for (let x of names) {  text += x + “ ”;}console.log (text)3. while loopthis type of loop, loops through a block of code continuously if the condition of operation remains true. for example;var i =0; while(i < 6) { console.log(i); i++; }the above code will continue to run until the condition which is (i <6) remains true.4. do while loopin javascript, a do-while loop  is similar to while loop, the major difference is run after the condition of an operation has run successfully. so do-while loop will execute the code block at least once. for example;var i = 0; do{ alert(i); i++; } while(i < 6)that will be all for now.   \n",

       "1348  hello again, welcome,for a car to move from one destination to another, it is important that the wheels keep working continuously until it arrives at the expected destination. in computer programming, an operation can be continuous until a result is reached, usually referred to as loop. what is a loop?                                                                                                                                                     a  loop is referred to as a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition or result  is reached. to express the condition that an operation should rely on, then we have to learn how to write conditional statements,if statement                                                                                                                                               this is use to execute an operation based on some condition, it loops through a code block multiple times. for example;if( condition) {code or operation to execute; }let practicalize it,<script>if( 2 >  0) {       alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 }</script>if else statementthis statement is used when you want to execute a code each time the first if condition evaluates to false. the else statement must follow if or else if statement. for example;  if( condition) {code or operation to execute; }else {execute another operation;}<script>if( 2 ,  0) {       alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 } else{   alert(\"2 is not greater than 0\");                   }</script> else if statement: just like the if statement, this is used when you want to execute a code each time the first if condition evaluates to false. the else if statement is used when there is a second level condition and the major difference is that it allows multiple conditions after the if statement. for example; <script> if( 2 >  0) {        alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 } else if (2==0) {    alert(\"2 is not greater than 0\");                   } </script>   types of loops in javascriptfor loop: this enables looping through a block of code multiple times. to write a for loop, three important things are required;1. initializer:  this helps to define or declare a counter variable for the condition or a variable where our operation begins. 2. condition: this is the condition our operation depends on, it is on this the iteration depends on.3. iteration: this serves as the increment or decrement to our initialized variable.for example;<script>for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) { console.log(i); }</script> in the above, var i = 0, is the initializer.i < 7, is the condition.i ++, is the iteration.for in loop/ for of loop:these loop type are used to loop through the property of an object, for example; const name = {firstname:\"gabriel\", secondname:\"isaac\", age:45};let text = \"\";for (let x in name) {  text += name[x] + “”;}console.log (text)from this example, you should remember, javascript operator, which we used to run our operation.first you declare a variable as an object, so you declare an empty string that you will store the properties you looped through, then you remember you want to loop through this object using the for in loop,  which we did with the                                         for (let x in name)followed by the operation which is the                                           text += name[x] + “”;for the for of loop, example is belowconst names = [\"gabriel\", \"isaac\", \"lonimi\"];let text = \"\";for (let x of names) {  text += x + “ ”;}console.log (text)3. while loopthis type of loop, loops through a block of code continuously if the condition of operation remains true. for example;var i =0; while(i < 6) { console.log(i); i++; }the above code will continue to run until the condition which is (i <6) remains true.4. do while loopin javascript, a do-while loop  is similar to while loop, the major difference is run after the condition of an operation has run successfully. so do-while loop will execute the code block at least once. for example;var i = 0; do{ alert(i); i++; } while(i < 6)that will be all for now.   \n",

       "      <td>hello again, welcome,for a car to move from one destination to another, it is important that the wheels keep working continuously until it arrives at the expected destination. in computer programming, an operation can be continuous until a result is reached, usually referred to as loop. what is a loop?                                                                                                                                                     a  loop is referred to as a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition or result  is reached. to express the condition that an operation should rely on, then we have to learn how to write conditional statements,if statement                                                                                                                                               this is use to execute an operation based on some condition, it loops through a code block multiple times. for example;if( condition) {code or operation to execute; }let practicalize it,&lt;script&gt;if( 2 &gt;  0) {       alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 }&lt;/script&gt;if else statementthis statement is used when you want to execute a code each time the first if condition evaluates to false. the else statement must follow if or else if statement. for example;  if( condition) {code or operation to execute; }else {execute another operation;}&lt;script&gt;if( 2 ,  0) {       alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 } else{   alert(\"2 is not greater than 0\");                   }&lt;/script&gt; else if statement: just like the if statement, this is used when you want to execute a code each time the first if condition evaluates to false. the else if statement is used when there is a second level condition and the major difference is that it allows multiple conditions after the if statement. for example; &lt;script&gt; if( 2 &gt;  0) {        alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 } else if (2==0) {    alert(\"2 is not greater than 0\");                   } &lt;/script&gt;   types of loops in javascriptfor loop: this enables looping through a block of code multiple times. to write a for loop, three important things are required;1. initializer:  this helps to define or declare a counter variable for the condition or a variable where our operation begins. 2. condition: this is the condition our operation depends on, it is on this the iteration depends on.3. iteration: this serves as the increment or decrement to our initialized variable.for example;&lt;script&gt;for (var i = 0; i &lt; 7; i++) { console.log(i); }&lt;/script&gt; in the above, var i = 0, is the initializer.i &lt; 7, is the condition.i ++, is the iteration.for in loop/ for of loop:these loop type are used to loop through the property of an object, for example; const name = {firstname:\"gabriel\", secondname:\"isaac\", age:45};let text = \"\";for (let x in name) {  text += name[x] + “”;}console.log (text)from this example, you should remember, javascript operator, which we used to run our operation.first you declare a variable as an object, so you declare an empty string that you will store the properties you looped through, then you remember you want to loop through this object using the for in loop,  which we did with the                                         for (let x in name)followed by the operation which is the                                           text += name[x] + “”;for the for of loop, example is belowconst names = [\"gabriel\", \"isaac\", \"lonimi\"];let text = \"\";for (let x of names) {  text += x + “ ”;}console.log (text)3. while loopthis type of loop, loops through a block of code continuously if the condition of operation remains true. for example;var i =0; while(i &lt; 6) { console.log(i); i++; }the above code will continue to run until the condition which is (i &lt;6) remains true.4. do while loopin javascript, a do-while loop  is similar to while loop, the major difference is run after the condition of an operation has run successfully. so do-while loop will execute the code block at least once. for example;var i = 0; do{ alert(i); i++; } while(i &lt; 6)that will be all for now.</td>\n",

       "      <td>hello guys, welcome again.in the previous lesson, we learnt about javascript functions, so we all are familiar with the word functions. javascript is  synchronous by default, the operation in javascript is carried out one at a time, that is, one step to another, if one step is not completed you can't move to another. but this can be stressful, takes longer time and can make our website boring, lets take for example, josh, was very hungry, he needs to eat something fast, unfortunately, his mum is making beans and we all know, beans takes too much time, seeing his state of hunger, his mum gave him some biscuit to snack on to reduce the hunger while the bean gets done.what josh and his mother just did is called asynchronous operation, such that while waiting for the beans to get done, josh ate a snack to quench hunger. if josh had waited for the beans and maybe ate the snack later that is called a synchronous operation.like we have said, javascript is synchronous by default. however, javascript has the ability to function as asynchronous, that is programs can run independently, one program doesn't have to wait for the other to finish running before it begins operation. this is done using two clauses which are, “async” and  “await”. asyncthe async functions enable us to write our codes based on promise, such that we can perform a synchronous-like function but one function or program won't stop the other or next and it must return a value. i know you might like to ask, 'what is a promise based code?'“ a promise represents an operation that hasn't been completed yet, although it will be completed in the future and return a value”. example of an async function,async function seeasyn(){return 78;}seeasync().then(alert);the above will return an output of 78, because the promise is returned. awaitthe await clause is used to wait for a promise, that is, it is used when a promise has been made. it can be used inside an async block only. this keyword indicates that a promise must be fulfilled before running the async promise or function. note : only the async function waits and not the whole program.that’s all for this class, bye!</td>\n",

       "1401  hello again, welcome,for a car to move from one destination to another, it is important that the wheels keep working continuously until it arrives at the expected destination. in computer programming, an operation can be continuous until a result is reached, usually referred to as loop. what is a loop?                                                                                                                                                     a  loop is referred to as a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition or result  is reached. to express the condition that an operation should rely on, then we have to learn how to write conditional statements,if statement                                                                                                                                               this is use to execute an operation based on some condition, it loops through a code block multiple times. for example;if( condition) {code or operation to execute; }let practicalize it,<script>if( 2 >  0) {       alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 }</script>if else statementthis statement is used when you want to execute a code each time the first if condition evaluates to false. the else statement must follow if or else if statement. for example;  if( condition) {code or operation to execute; }else {execute another operation;}<script>if( 2 ,  0) {       alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 } else{   alert(\"2 is not greater than 0\");                   }</script> else if statement: just like the if statement, this is used when you want to execute a code each time the first if condition evaluates to false. the else if statement is used when there is a second level condition and the major difference is that it allows multiple conditions after the if statement. for example; <script> if( 2 >  0) {        alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 } else if (2==0) {    alert(\"2 is not greater than 0\");                   } </script>   types of loops in javascriptfor loop: this enables looping through a block of code multiple times. to write a for loop, three important things are required;1. initializer:  this helps to define or declare a counter variable for the condition or a variable where our operation begins. 2. condition: this is the condition our operation depends on, it is on this the iteration depends on.3. iteration: this serves as the increment or decrement to our initialized variable.for example;<script>for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) { console.log(i); }</script> in the above, var i = 0, is the initializer.i < 7, is the condition.i ++, is the iteration.for in loop/ for of loop:these loop type are used to loop through the property of an object, for example; const name = {firstname:\"gabriel\", secondname:\"isaac\", age:45};let text = \"\";for (let x in name) {  text += name[x] + “”;}console.log (text)from this example, you should remember, javascript operator, which we used to run our operation.first you declare a variable as an object, so you declare an empty string that you will store the properties you looped through, then you remember you want to loop through this object using the for in loop,  which we did with the                                         for (let x in name)followed by the operation which is the                                           text += name[x] + “”;for the for of loop, example is belowconst names = [\"gabriel\", \"isaac\", \"lonimi\"];let text = \"\";for (let x of names) {  text += x + “ ”;}console.log (text)3. while loopthis type of loop, loops through a block of code continuously if the condition of operation remains true. for example;var i =0; while(i < 6) { console.log(i); i++; }the above code will continue to run until the condition which is (i <6) remains true.4. do while loopin javascript, a do-while loop  is similar to while loop, the major difference is run after the condition of an operation has run successfully. so do-while loop will execute the code block at least once. for example;var i = 0; do{ alert(i); i++; } while(i < 6)that will be all for now.  \n",

       "      <th>hello again, welcome,for a car to move from one destination to another, it is important that the wheels keep working continuously until it arrives at the expected destination. in computer programming, an operation can be continuous until a result is reached, usually referred to as loop. what is a loop?                                                                                                                                                     a  loop is referred to as a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition or result  is reached. to express the condition that an operation should rely on, then we have to learn how to write conditional statements,if statement                                                                                                                                               this is use to execute an operation based on some condition, it loops through a code block multiple times. for example;if( condition) {code or operation to execute; }let practicalize it,&lt;script&gt;if( 2 &gt;  0) {       alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 }&lt;/script&gt;if else statementthis statement is used when you want to execute a code each time the first if condition evaluates to false. the else statement must follow if or else if statement. for example;  if( condition) {code or operation to execute; }else {execute another operation;}&lt;script&gt;if( 2 ,  0) {       alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 } else{   alert(\"2 is not greater than 0\");                   }&lt;/script&gt; else if statement: just like the if statement, this is used when you want to execute a code each time the first if condition evaluates to false. the else if statement is used when there is a second level condition and the major difference is that it allows multiple conditions after the if statement. for example; &lt;script&gt; if( 2 &gt;  0) {        alert(\"2 is greater than 0\");                 } else if (2==0) {    alert(\"2 is not greater than 0\");                   } &lt;/script&gt;   types of loops in javascriptfor loop: this enables looping through a block of code multiple times. to write a for loop, three important things are required;1. initializer:  this helps to define or declare a counter variable for the condition or a variable where our operation begins. 2. condition: this is the condition our operation depends on, it is on this the iteration depends on.3. iteration: this serves as the increment or decrement to our initialized variable.for example;&lt;script&gt;for (var i = 0; i &lt; 7; i++) { console.log(i); }&lt;/script&gt; in the above, var i = 0, is the initializer.i &lt; 7, is the condition.i ++, is the iteration.for in loop/ for of loop:these loop type are used to loop through the property of an object, for example; const name = {firstname:\"gabriel\", secondname:\"isaac\", age:45};let text = \"\";for (let x in name) {  text += name[x] + “”;}console.log (text)from this example, you should remember, javascript operator, which we used to run our operation.first you declare a variable as an object, so you declare an empty string that you will store the properties you looped through, then you remember you want to loop through this object using the for in loop,  which we did with the                                         for (let x in name)followed by the operation which is the                                           text += name[x] + “”;for the for of loop, example is belowconst names = [\"gabriel\", \"isaac\", \"lonimi\"];let text = \"\";for (let x of names) {  text += x + “ ”;}console.log (text)3. while loopthis type of loop, loops through a block of code continuously if the condition of operation remains true. for example;var i =0; while(i &lt; 6) { console.log(i); i++; }the above code will continue to run until the condition which is (i &lt;6) remains true.4. do while loopin javascript, a do-while loop  is similar to while loop, the major difference is run after the condition of an operation has run successfully. so do-while loop will execute the code block at least once. for example;var i = 0; do{ alert(i); i++; } while(i &lt; 6)that will be all for now.</th>\n",
       "      <th>it's another session on javascript, welcome again.scopingin javascript, there is a concept called scoping and probably unknown to you we have been using it in some of our previous lessons. scoping means the possibility of us to access a variable or object or method. there are two major types of scoping in javascript;global scope.local scope.1. global scopeglobal scopes are referred to as variables that are declared outside of a code block or functions such that it can be accessed or used by any function. for example;&lt;script&gt; var firstname = \"gabriel\"; function modifyfirstname() { firstname = \"issac\"; }; function showfirstname() { alert(firstname); }; alert(firstname); modifyfirstname(); showfirstname();&lt;/script&gt;2. local scopea variable declared within a function is referred to as local scope, this type of scope can only be accessed by the function. for example;  &lt;script&gt; function createfirstname() { var username = \"gabriel\"; } function showfirstname() { alert(username);}createfirstname();showfirstname();&lt;/script&gt;hoisting just as scoping, hoisting is also a concept in javascript, this enables the use of a variable or function before declaring it, this is mostly impossible in some other scripting or programming languages. this is possible because javascript by default sends the variable declaration to the top of the code.for example; x = 1; alert('x = ' + x);var x;the above will print x = 1.</th>\n",
       "      <th>hello guys, welcome again.in the previous lesson, we learnt about javascript functions, so we all are familiar with the word functions. javascript is  synchronous by default, the operation in javascript is carried out one at a time, that is, one step to another, if one step is not completed you can't move to another. but this can be stressful, takes longer time and can make our website boring, lets take for example, josh, was very hungry, he needs to eat something fast, unfortunately, his mum is making beans and we all know, beans takes too much time, seeing his state of hunger, his mum gave him some biscuit to snack on to reduce the hunger while the bean gets done.what josh and his mother just did is called asynchronous operation, such that while waiting for the beans to get done, josh ate a snack to quench hunger. if josh had waited for the beans and maybe ate the snack later that is called a synchronous operation.like we have said, javascript is synchronous by default. however, javascript has the ability to function as asynchronous, that is programs can run independently, one program doesn't have to wait for the other to finish running before it begins operation. this is done using two clauses which are, “async” and  “await”. asyncthe async functions enable us to write our codes based on promise, such that we can perform a synchronous-like function but one function or program won't stop the other or next and it must return a value. i know you might like to ask, 'what is a promise based code?'“ a promise represents an operation that hasn't been completed yet, although it will be completed in the future and return a value”. example of an async function,async function seeasyn(){return 78;}seeasync().then(alert);the above will return an output of 78, because the promise is returned. awaitthe await clause is used to wait for a promise, that is, it is used when a promise has been made. it can be used inside an async block only. this keyword indicates that a promise must be fulfilled before running the async promise or function. note : only the async function waits and not the whole program.that’s all for this class, bye!</th>\n",

       "      <td>cultureculture is the totality of the way of life of a people. it includes the peoples’ beliefs, their mode of worship, their arts and crafts, language, religion, technology, dressing, their way of thinking, dancing, greeting, and eating habits.culture varies from place to place. for example, the culture of hausa is different from that of yoruba and efik people, so is that of igbo people different from that of kanuri and gwari people.a society is known by its culture. people can therefore be identified by their way of doing things. as society changes, the culture of such society reflects such changes. new ideas, thoughts, arts, and ways of life are learned by the people.usually, when people from different cultures meet and exchange ideas, values and beliefs with one another, their cultures are affected. people learn their own culture, the culture of where they reside, the culture of the people they come in contact with. this learning and use of other peoples’ culture is called acculturation. components or aspects of cultureculture is made up of two components:material culturenon-material culture material culturethis is also called tangible culture. it consists mainly of the products of man’s industry or arts. it consists of the things the society makes to meet the needs of the people. some of such things are furniture, buildings, sculpture, bridges, and books. non-material culturethis is also called the intangible culture. it refers to those aspects of culture that are not visible like language, religion, morality, belief, music, and knowledge.the major difference between the two aspects of culture is that the tangible or material culture can be seen, touched, and felt, while the intangible aspect of our culture cannot be seen or touched. the components of culture are rules and regulations, guiding people’s behaviour, religion, beliefs, attitudes, values, language, dress style, eating habits, ceremonies, arts, etc. features of cultureculture is dynamic and flexible. it neither static nor rigid.culture is learnt over a period of time. it is therefore not inborn in people. it is not what you have at birth. it is what a child learns as he grows and mixes with people of that locality.culture is continuous and does not die with people. this means that the culture of the people is passed down from one generation to another, without any break. this is to ensure continuity of the culture of a particular race or tribe.culture differs from place to place. this means that every culture is unique to particular set of people.culture is universal to mankind and not peculiar to a particular group. since any culture fits and serves the people who own it, it can be rightly claimed that no culture is superior to the other.elements of culture/cultural differences there are between 250 and 400 ethnic groups in nigeria. these major groups have their own languages and customs. the natural environment is one of the major factors which produce cultural differentiation. cultural difference can also be observed in the following areas:arts/ crafts: in the forest zones, wood carving is a form of tradition, wood is carved to show ingenuity. we have calabash carving in oyo, there are ife and benin bronzes, the bida metal work, glass beads and bangles industries. while leather works are produced in kano, woven raffia is produced in ikot ekpene, mat weaving is done at ipoti-ekiti, ekiti state, while pottery is done in abuja. religion: apart from the african tradition, which is common in nigeria, the nigerian also practise two other prominent religions. these are christianity and islam. while islam is mainly practised in the northern part of the country, christianity takes its roots in the southern part of the country. the differences in languages are connected with differences in myths, legends, superstitions, and ideologies. food: there are different food types in nigeria, and they vary from area to area. delicacies like the ogbono soup, okazi soup, and bitter leaf soup are peculiar to the igbo people while ewedu soup, efo riro, pounded yam and amala are peculiar to yoruba people and tuwo and kunu are peculiar to hausa/ fulani people. dress: people from different parts of the country wear different types and colours of clothes, igbo men wear shirt and wrapper, while their women wear wrapper and blouse. yoruba men wear agbada while their women wear iro and buba. the hausa men wear babariga, while their women clothe which covers all parts of the body except the face. housing: there are differences in the housing pattern of each ethnic group or culture. these differences are brought about by differences in vegetation and weather, which are prevalent in the different regions. greetings: styles of greetings vary from culture to culture. each ethnic tribe has a unique way of greeting. these styles range from bending to kneeling down in the case of the yoruba people, and squatting or kneeling in the case of the hausa and fulani people. occupation and products: the different types of vegetation and weather in each region also determine the occupation and products of each ethnic groups. this is why the riverine areas of the rivers, bayelsa and delta states are known for their fishing and crude oil drilling, while states such as edo, ogun and ondo states which have thick forests are known for lumbering. the north is renowned for rearing livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats. the north is also known for the production of grains, onion, yam, and tomato.</td>\n",

seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. the standard unit for measuring time is seconds.table of time 60 seconds1 minutes (min)60 minutes1 hour (hr.)24 hours1 day (d)7 days1 week (wk.)4 weeks1 month12 months1 year (yr.)365 days1 year366 days1 leap year10 years1 decade100 years1 century1000 years1 millennium  changing unitswhen changing unit in time, the relationship between each unit as shown in the table of time above must be used. example: mary recorded music for 145 minutes. how many hours and minutes did she record the music? solution 60minutes = 1 hour this means when changing from minutes to hours, we divide by 6014560 2 remainder 25so therefore 145minutes = 2hrs 25minutes or 2 2560 = 2 125 hrs john worked on his mathematics homework for hours. how many minutes did he work for? solution 60 minutes = 1hour this means when changing from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60.2 12 = 2 12 × 60 minutes52 × 60 = 3002 = 150 minutes  it took moses exactly 3hours 17minutes to drive from jos to abuja. how many minutes is this? solution3 hours = 3 × 60 = 180 minutes 3 hours 17minutes = 180 minutes + 17 minutes = 197 minutesthe school coordinator of berkley academy was on vacation for 2 weeks 4 days. how many days is this?solution7 days = 1 weekthis means that when changing days to week, we divide by 7 and when changing weeks to days, we multiply by 7.2 weeks = 2 × 7 days = 14 days2 weeks 4days = 14 days + 4 days = 18daysadditon and subtraction of timeaddition and subtraction can be done on time when the 12 hour clock and 24 clocks are well understood. take a look at the table below: 12 hour clock24 hours clock7:00 am7hrs 00min4:30pm16hrs 30mins3:50am3hrs 50mins7:20pm19hrs 20mins12pm12hrs 00min12am24hrs 00min from a.m to p.m change only p.m to 24 hour clock by adding 12 to it.from p.m to a.m change only a.m to 24 hour clock by adding 12 to it.example:susan worked at the hospital for 3 hours 35mins in the morning and 2hours 45minns. in the afternoon. how long did susan work that day? solution:5hrs 80mins can be further simplified because 80min is already more than 60 minutes.80minutes = 1hr 20minutesso therefore 5hrs 80mins = 5hrs + 1hr 20mins = 6hrs 20mins.  3. is19hrs 38mins 72seconds can be further simplified because 72seconds already more than 60seconds.72 seconds = 1min 12secsso therefore 19hrs 38mins 72seconds = 19hrs + 38mins + 1min 12seconds = 19hrs. 39mins 12secondsjoshua completed a job in 4hrs 30minutes. his sister josephine completed the same job in 5hrs 15mins. how much longer did it take josephine to finish the job?solutionsteps taken30 minutes cannot be subtracted from 15 minutes so we have to borrow 1hr from 5hrs.hr borrowed from 5hrs is added as 60min since 1hr = 60minutesafterwards, subtract normally. steps taken➢         48 seconds cannot besubtracted from 32 seconds so we borrow 1min from 18mins which is added as 60 seconds to get 92 seconds because 1min = 60 seconds18 minutes cannot be subtracted from the remaining 17 minutes so we borrow 1hr from 5hrs which is added as 60 minutes to get 77 minutes because 1hr = 60 minutesfinal answer is 1hr 59min 44secondsandre slept around 8:15pm and woke up 4:30am. find the time he spent sleeping.solutionin this case we are moving from p.m to a.m, so we are changing only a.m by adding 12 to it.8:15 p.m = 8 hrs 15mins4:30 a.m = 16 hrs 30mins (i.e 4 + 16) time elapsed will be,what is the length of time taken on a journey which begins at 8:27a.m and ends at 2:16p.msolutionin this case, we are moving from a.m to p.m , so we are changing only p.m 8:27a.m = 8hrs 27 mins2:16p.m = 14hrs 16mins (i.e 2 + 12) time taken will be,quizhow many minutes are there from 12:15p.m to 3:45pm?school starts at 8am. if yemi arrived at 7:47am, how many minutes early or late was she?a lesson which takes 1 hour 45minutes starts at 10:35 a.m. what time does the lesson end?  \n",

who was willing to share (john 6:1-13)jesus went to a mountain place with his disciples and a great multitude came to meet them there. jesus was moved with compassion for the crowd that came to meet him there. he knew that the crowd needed food. so, he asked from his disciples how to get food for the crowd. the only food that was available is five barley loaves of bread and two small fishes that belong to a small boy. the little boy was calling to share his food. he released his food to jesus and jesus blessed the food and the food multiplied and went round everyone present which were 5,000 men apart from children and women that were not counted. after everybody ate satisfactorily, twelve baskets of bread remained.two lessons we can learn from here:jesus is ever ready to give us what we

(acts 16:9)paul and his companion travelled throughout the region of phrygia and galatia, having been warned by the holy spirit from preaching the word in the province of asia. when they got to the mysia, they tried to enter bithynia but the spirit of jesus would not allow them to. so, they passed by mysia to troas. during the night paul had a vision of a man of macedonia standing and begging him “come over to macedonia and help us”. at once, paul got ready to leave for macedonia. he told the others that god had called them to preach the gospel to them.  moral lessonsit is good to obey the holy spiritit is good to be sensitive when god speaks to us just like paulit is good to go where god wants us to go like paul.                     quiz activitieswhat happened to paul and his companions when they tried to enter bithynia?answer: the spirit of jesus would not allow them enter bithyniawhat happened to paul at night?answer: paul had a vision.what did he see?answer: he saw a man begging him to come over to macedonia and help them.did paul go to macedonia?answer: yes, he went to macedonia.   \n",

he cannot save himself. he is the king of israel; let him come down from the cross, and we will believe in him. he trusts in god; let god deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, “i am the son of god.”jesus was in pain. he suffered a lot and he was feeling serious pain. jesus hung on the cross for three hours, there was darkness everywhere.jesus then cried in a loud voice saying:“eloi, eloi lama sabachthani” meaning: “my god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?after saying this, jesus died on the cross. the importance of jesus laying down his life for usto save us from sin and death: the importance of jesus suffering and death is to save us from sin and death. as children of god we should accept jesus into our lives and forsake sin so that the death and suffering of jesus will not be in vain. the resurrection. mark 16: 1-8the raising of jesus from the dead by the power of god is called the ‘resurrection’when jesus was alive, he said that three days after his death, he would rise. therefore, three days after he was buried, jesus rose from the dead.mary magdalene came to the tomb on the third day, and she was told by an angel that jesus had risen from the dead.jesus appeared to mary magdalene, but at first, she did not recognize him. she asked him if he knew where they had taken the body of jesus. then, jesus called her name, “mary.”she recognized jesus and wanted to hold him. but jesus said he must first ascend into heaven. he told her to inform the disciples that he was ascending to god, the father. mary went and informed the disciples.in the evening, jesus appeared to the disciples. he said to them: “peace be with you.”jesus gave them the holy spirit. he also gave them the authority to forgive sins.thomas was not present when jesus appeared to the rest of the disciples. when they told him that jesus had risen, he doubted it until jesus told him to put hand into his wounds. thomas was now convinced that jesus had risen from the dead. moral lessongod wants us to thank him for raising jesus up from the dead.god wants us to believe in resurrection as our hope for eternal life. quiz activitieswhat is resurrection?answer: the raising of jesus from the dead by the power of god is called the ‘resurrection’ when did jesus rise from the dead?answer: on the third day. who doubted that jesus had risen from the dead?answer: thomas.  who gave the disciples the holy spirit?answer: jesus.     \n",

       "48  cultureculture is the totality of the way of life of a people. it includes the peoples’ beliefs, their mode of worship, their arts and crafts, language, religion, technology, dressing, their way of thinking, dancing, greeting, and eating habits.culture varies from place to place. for example, the culture of hausa is different from that of yoruba and efik people, so is that of igbo people different from that of kanuri and gwari people.a society is known by its culture. people can therefore be identified by their way of doing things. as society changes, the culture of such society reflects such changes. new ideas, thoughts, arts, and ways of life are learned by the people.usually, when people from different cultures meet and exchange ideas, values and beliefs with one another, their cultures are affected. people learn their own culture, the culture of where they reside, the culture of the people they come in contact with. this learning and use of other peoples’ culture is called acculturation. components or aspects of cultureculture is made up of two components:material culturenon-material culture material culturethis is also called tangible culture. it consists mainly of the products of man’s industry or arts. it consists of the things the society makes to meet the needs of the people. some of such things are furniture, buildings, sculpture, bridges, and books. non-material culturethis is also called the intangible culture. it refers to those aspects of culture that are not visible like language, religion, morality, belief, music, and knowledge.the major difference between the two aspects of culture is that the tangible or material culture can be seen, touched, and felt, while the intangible aspect of our culture cannot be seen or touched. the components of culture are rules and regulations, guiding people’s behaviour, religion, beliefs, attitudes, values, language, dress style, eating habits, ceremonies, arts, etc. features of cultureculture is dynamic and flexible. it neither static nor rigid.culture is learnt over a period of time. it is therefore not inborn in people. it is not what you have at birth. it is what a child learns as he grows and mixes with people of that locality.culture is continuous and does not die with people. this means that the culture of the people is passed down from one generation to another, without any break. this is to ensure continuity of the culture of a particular race or tribe.culture differs from place to place. this means that every culture is unique to particular set of people.culture is universal to mankind and not peculiar to a particular group. since any culture fits and serves the people who own it, it can be rightly claimed that no culture is superior to the other.elements of culture/cultural differences there are between 250 and 400 ethnic groups in nigeria. these major groups have their own languages and customs. the natural environment is one of the major factors which produce cultural differentiation. cultural difference can also be observed in the following areas:arts/ crafts: in the forest zones, wood carving is a form of tradition, wood is carved to show ingenuity. we have calabash carving in oyo, there are ife and benin bronzes, the bida metal work, glass beads and bangles industries. while leather works are produced in kano, woven raffia is produced in ikot ekpene, mat weaving is done at ipoti-ekiti, ekiti state, while pottery is done in abuja. religion: apart from the african tradition, which is common in nigeria, the nigerian also practise two other prominent religions. these are christianity and islam. while islam is mainly practised in the northern part of the country, christianity takes its roots in the southern part of the country. the differences in languages are connected with differences in myths, legends, superstitions, and ideologies. food: there are different food types in nigeria, and they vary from area to area. delicacies like the ogbono soup, okazi soup, and bitter leaf soup are peculiar to the igbo people while ewedu soup, efo riro, pounded yam and amala are peculiar to yoruba people and tuwo and kunu are peculiar to hausa/ fulani people. dress: people from different parts of the country wear different types and colours of clothes, igbo men wear shirt and wrapper, while their women wear wrapper and blouse. yoruba men wear agbada while their women wear iro and buba. the hausa men wear babariga, while their women clothe which covers all parts of the body except the face. housing: there are differences in the housing pattern of each ethnic group or culture. these differences are brought about by differences in vegetation and weather, which are prevalent in the different regions. greetings: styles of greetings vary from culture to culture. each ethnic tribe has a unique way of greeting. these styles range from bending to kneeling down in the case of the yoruba people, and squatting or kneeling in the case of the hausa and fulani people. occupation and products: the different types of vegetation and weather in each region also determine the occupation and products of each ethnic groups. this is why the riverine areas of the rivers, bayelsa and delta states are known for their fishing and crude oil drilling, while states such as edo, ogun and ondo states which have thick forests are known for lumbering. the north is renowned for rearing livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats. the north is also known for the production of grains, onion, yam, and tomato.    \n",

in our ways of life. the differences in our ways of life could be in the areas of marriage, religion, feeding, language, greetings, tradition, etc.our attitude towards cultural diversity must be in the following ways: we must learn to tolerate other people’s ways of life i.e. their culture.we must respect their ways of life.we must accept them.we must appreciate the good qualities in our different cultures.we need to mix with people who hold different views and who have different cultural backgrounds. respect for other people’s views why we must listen to other people’s viewswe must listen to other people’s views because for the following reasons:we may learn certain things from the views of other people.it will help us to avoid making wrong decisions or judgement about others.it will help us to relate with understanding with others.we need to listen to others because they are also human beings.they are citizens of our country or another country.other people have a right to express their views, which may be different from our own.we could share ideas.we must show that we consider other people’s views important.it will make them feel accepted in our midst.  importance/reasons why we must respect other people’s views, beliefs, and traditionthe following are some of the importance or reasons why we must listen and respect other people’s views, beliefs, and tradition:there will be peace and harmony in society because conflicts and misunderstanding will be avoided.people will feel safe and happy in society.there will be peaceful co-existence in the community.there will be cooperation and friendliness among the citizens.the government will be able to perform its duties when there is peace in society.people will be able to live without fear in any part of the country.citizens will be free to work without fear in any part of nigeria no matter where they come from.it gives us an opportunity to learn from one another.the basic law of our country (the constitution) allows everybody to practise the religion of their choice. it is therefore their right to hold any religious belief.religious crises will be avoided if we respect other people’s religious beliefs and tradition. how to respect other people’s views, beliefs, and traditionsit is important to respect other people’s views, beliefs, and traditions. nigeria is a large country made up of many ethnic groups with different cultural backgrounds. these cultural groups have their own beliefs and traditions.we live together in the same community and work together too. at times we attend schools together despite our differences. we therefore need to respect other people’s beliefs and traditions if we are to live peacefully with one another. we can do this in the following ways:tolerance: there is need to make room for our differences. it will be easy to tolerate and be friends with other people who are not like us, when we understand that we cannot all hold the same religious and traditional beliefs.understanding: there will be peace if we show understanding. we should accept other people the way they are, instead of emphasising the differences between us.appreciating differences: we respect other people’s views, beliefs, and traditions if we appreciate the good qualities which are in these beliefs and traditions.learning about the differences: we can show respect by deliberately showing interest in learning about the views, religious beliefs and traditions which are different from ours. quizanswer the following questions:how can you respect and tolerate other people’s culture?why must we listen to other people’s views?give four reasons why we must respect and tolerate other people’s views, beliefs, and traditions.          "

       "1720  welcome to class meaning of natural resourcesnatural resources are the minerals, water, energy, land, plants and animals which we find around us which are not made by man. natural resources are valuable in their form. it is the wealth found in our country.nigeria’s natural resourcesnigeria has many natural resources including:land: to grow products such as cocoa, groundnut and palm kernel.crude oil: for petrol, diesel, lubricant and to export to other markets for revenue.natural gas: for energy to generate electricity and to export to other markets for revenue.forestry: for trees, for wood, energy and paper products and plants for drugs.water: for fishing for ourselves and for exports to other markets for revenue.iron ore: used to make steel which is crucial for constructing machinery, tools, ships and cars.coal: for energy.cotton: is used to make our clothes.columbite: is used to make the body of aircraft.rubber: is used to make tyres and shoes.developing our resourcesthe process by which natural resources are turned into finished goods is called production. production can be divided into three categories:primary production: it involves the extraction of raw materials from the soil or sea. goods available at this stage are raw materials.secondary production: it is the stage in which the raw materials is processed and transformed into finished products. the process is known as manufacturing.tertiary production: tertiary production is the stage at which the finished goods are supplied to the consumers. after goods are manufactured, it needs to get to the final user. the people who buy and use manufactured goods are called consumers. this stage completes the production process.chain of distributionthis is the process the raw materials go through before reaching the final consumer.the manufacturer buy raw materials and turn them into goods for distribution.the wholesaler is the trader who buy goods in large quantities from the manufacturer and sell them in smaller quantities to the retailer. they find market for the manufactured goods. they are also called middlemen because they serve as a bridge between the manufacturer and the retailer.the retailer buy goods in small quantities from the wholesaler and sell them in units to the final consumer. they complete the production process by taking the goods to the final consumer.contribution of individuals and organization to resources developmenteducationtechnologypeaceful environmentlandprotection   \n",

       "1720  welcome to class meaning of natural resourcesnatural resources are the minerals, water, energy, land, plants and animals which we find around us which are not made by man. natural resources are valuable in their form. it is the wealth found in our country.nigeria’s natural resourcesnigeria has many natural resources including:land: to grow products such as cocoa, groundnut and palm kernel.crude oil: for petrol, diesel, lubricant and to export to other markets for revenue.natural gas: for energy to generate electricity and to export to other markets for revenue.forestry: for trees, for wood, energy and paper products and plants for drugs.water: for fishing for ourselves and for exports to other markets for revenue.iron ore: used to make steel which is crucial for constructing machinery, tools, ships and cars.coal: for energy.cotton: is used to make our clothes.columbite: is used to make the body of aircraft.rubber: is used to make tyres and shoes.developing our resourcesthe process by which natural resources are turned into finished goods is called production. production can be divided into three categories:primary production: it involves the extraction of raw materials from the soil or sea. goods available at this stage are raw materials.secondary production: it is the stage in which the raw materials is processed and transformed into finished products. the process is known as manufacturing.tertiary production: tertiary production is the stage at which the finished goods are supplied to the consumers. after goods are manufactured, it needs to get to the final user. the people who buy and use manufactured goods are called consumers. this stage completes the production process.chain of distributionthis is the process the raw materials go through before reaching the final consumer.the manufacturer buy raw materials and turn them into goods for distribution.the wholesaler is the trader who buy goods in large quantities from the manufacturer and sell them in smaller quantities to the retailer. they find market for the manufactured goods. they are also called middlemen because they serve as a bridge between the manufacturer and the retailer.the retailer buy goods in small quantities from the wholesaler and sell them in units to the final consumer. they complete the production process by taking the goods to the final consumer.contribution of individuals and organization to resources developmenteducationtechnologypeaceful environmentlandprotection  \n",

       "5     welcome back to class  in the last lesson we treated some of the general processes or procedures for growing farm crops. we looked at the process of land clearing, stumping, tilling and planting.  in today’s lesson, we will look at more processes and procedure:weeding: weeding is carried out about three weeks after planting. during weeding, ridges or mounds that may have been washed off, are also remoulded. weeding may be repeated after four weeksfertiliser application: fertiliser is applied to the crop after weeding. the application may be in a ring form, in  holes or by broadcasting, depending on the type of cereal planted. the application may be repeated after four weeks.  harvesting: some cereals produce flowers about two months after planting. they produce mature grains about one month after. the mature grains are then harvested for processing and storage. cereals like maize can be harvested green for food.processing and preservation: cereals like rice, sorghum and guinea corn are threshed after harvesting. the pure grains are removed by winnowing. maize cobs are shelled to remove the grains. cereal grains are dried to reduce their water or moisture content before bagging or storage.storage and marketing: grains can be stored in bags, plastic containers, cribs or silos. cereal grains, such as rice, millet and maize are sold in bags, metal containers and plastic containers. evaluationmention the processes of growing cereal that was thought   \n",

There are some people who sell drugs legally, with permission from the government. We call these people legitimate drug sellers.
