## Community Statement

The educational landscape in Africa is in a coma with the high rate of out-ofschool children, over 50 percent failure in examinations and high cost of access to quality education. We created the Afrilearn platform for young people across Africa to access world-class education and excel by leveraging technology without the need to step foot into the four walls of a school. Our community is a crucible of expertise and collaboration amongst developers, tutors, animators, students and machine learning experts to ensure each student get the exact support, peculiar to their needs.
